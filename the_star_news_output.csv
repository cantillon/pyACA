Holder and Tammy Albarran, who are partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, will look into the complaints about a manager at Uber, as well as general questions about diversity and inclusion, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick told his employees in a memo on Monday that was seen by Reuters. Last year, Airbnb hired Holder, who served under former President Barack Obama, to help craft a policy to combat discrimination occurring through the online lodging service's platform. Arianna Huffington, who joined Uber's board last year, Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer, and Angela Padilla, the company's associate general counsel, will also help conduct the review, Kalanick said in the memo. Huffington, Kalanick and Hornsey will meet on Tuesday, the memo said. Susan Fowler, the former Uber employee who complained of being the target of sexual harassment by her manager, wrote in a blog post on Sunday that when she reported the offense to human resources officials and management, they declined to punish the alleged offender because he ""was a high performer"" and that this was his first offense."" Fowler also said, after speaking with other female employees, she realized that both HR and management had been lying about this being the manager's ""first offense."" In a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, Kalanick called Fowler's allegations ""abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in."" Fowler's tale prompted a backlash, including calls for a revival of the #DeleteUber movement. Some protesters urged a boycott of the ride service over allegations it sought to profit from the chaos at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport last month, after President Donald Trump’s executive order barring entry to people from seven Muslim majority countries. Many women working in Silicon Valley, particularly in highly technical roles, say they have experienced misogyny and harassment in the male-dominated field. Technology companies are under mounting pressure to make their workforces more diverse by hiring more women, blacks and Latinos - but progress has been slow. ""There have been many questions about the gender diversity of Uber's technology teams,"" Kalanick said. Uber will publish a broader diversity report for the company in the coming months, he said. ""I believe in creating a workplace where a deep sense of justice underpins everything we do,"" Kalanick said. ""Every Uber employee should be proud of the culture we have and what we will build together over time.""",http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/02/21/uber-hires-ex-us-attorney-general-holder-to-probe-sexual-harassment_c1510515
4,True,True,3.0,Editor,16 February 2019 - 00:00,,Caroline Mwatha: Time to talk about safe abortion,,"The tragic death of activist Caroline Mwatha, who died of a botched abortion — whether voluntarily procured or forcibly performed — should make us reflect of safe abortion. We should also ponder decriminalising the procedure in the first trimester, the practice in many Western countries. Opinion in Kenya is deeply divided. No one on either side of the debate likes the idea of abortion. Some are absolutely opposed, even in the case of a 9-year-old girl raped, made pregnant by her father and kicked out of her home. They say it's murder, even at the moment of conception, though the medical definition of pregnancy is embedding of a fertilised egg in the wall of the uterus. They further say that legalising abortion would promote promiscuity. Kenyan law makes abortion illegal in virtually all circumstances, unless a certified health professional says the life or health of the mother is in danger. In 2013 the Health ministry withdrew guidelines on performing safe abortions, a simple procedure early on, and on handling botched abortions. It has banned health workers from training on abortion. This is wrong and hasn't stopped women from seeking and dying from back-alley abortions.

6,True,False,0.0,By FELIX OLICK AND JAMES MBAKA,28 November 2018 - 06:00,,Boardroom tussles rock Kenya Pipeline,,"Sharp divisions in the top management are threatening to paralyse the troubled Kenya Pipeline Company. Yesterday, a make-or-break board meeting aborted over a quorum hitch amid claims that the fuel loss “scandal” was being engineered by a section of disgruntled board members to force management changes. Internal documents show the company has declined to pay oil marketers for the loss of 11 million liters of fuel, which has accentuated boardroom wars at the critical corporation. The botched meeting convened by KPC board chairman John Ngumi was to to seal the fate of managing director Joe Sang and some senior managers at the corporation. “The purpose of the aborted board meeting was simple, to send the entire management packing. If they think the MD has not performed, why don’t they decline to renew his contract instead or come up with tangible areas of poor performance and table them during performance appraisal instead of resorting to unorthodox means,” a source within KPC told the Star. Insiders who spoke to the Star in confidence for fear of reprisal blamed Ngumi for the series of “manufactured” scandals. “It’s unbelievable and unheard of that a board chairman would be behind scandalizing an organization he is meant to steer to greater heights,” said one source. Ngumi was not available for a comment as his phones were off most of yesterday. Unconfirmed reports indicated he was airborne to Mauritius. He has previously said he was not against anyone at the company but vowed never to tolerate incompetence. Turf wars pitting Ngumi against Managing Director Sang have persisted for some time, spilling to Parliament two weeks ago where they were forced by MPs to clarify allegations of dirty wars. To avert bitter exchanges in public, the National Assembly Energy committee chaired by Naivasha Town East MP David Gikaria was forced to conduct different sessions with Ngumi and Sang's team. While Ngumi accused the management of incompetence and inefficiency, Sang downplayed the frosty relationship and insisted all was well and the board was working in harmony with his team. Read: The anticipated expiry of Sang's term in March 2019, although he is eligible for extension of one more term of three years, is said to be at the centre of the standoff. It has triggered a vicious succession battle at the lucrative oil transporting firm. The list of directors who attended or were absconded from the meeting exposes the alignment and behind-the-scenes intrigues at the firm. As a signal of the seriousness of the crisis at KPC, Petroleum PS Andrew Kamau yesterday turned up for the meeting where he would ordinarily be represented by Huson Andambi. Also present were Ngumi — who is serving a second term as board chairman — and directors Rita Okuthe and Winnie Mukami. Those who did not turn up were alternate director (Treasury) Erick Korir, directors Jinaro Kibet and Felicity Biriri. The terms of two other directors, Iltasayon Neepe and Wahome Gitonga, have expired. The nine-member board requires at least 6 directors to form a quorum. COMPENSATION The contract with oil marketers seen by the Star protects the corporation from compensating for losses below 0.25 per cent of the total amount of fuel pumped through the pipeline within a period of six months. It states: “KPC shall be liable to and undertakes to indemnify the OMC for all losses of Products while such Products are in KPC's custody, including but not limited to, mal-operation of the pipelines, the terminals or appurtenant facilities, including pump stations, pipeline breaks, leaks and pilfering where such losses exceed 0.25% of products calculated by volume at 20 0 C within a period of six monthly moving average,” Oil marketing companies importing the product into the country are themselves compensated for ocean loss of up to 0.5% of the cost, insurance and freight (CIF). According to Kenya Pipeline, the firm only lost 0.15 per cent in the 2017/2018 financial year, which is much lower than the compensation threshold set out in the agreement. According to gain/loss provision, KPC had a loss of 0.17 per cent in 2014/2015, 0.2 per cent in 2015/2016 and 0.13 per cent in 2016/2017. The latest loss means that KPC’s insurer will not come in to compensate for the lost fuel as the insurance firms can only compensate for loss above 0.25 per cent. According to the documents, Kenya Pipeline lost 11.646 million litres — 5.956 million in spillage and 5.69 million to theft. KPC moved in excess of 12 billion litres during that period on behalf of the oil marketers and the loss was recorded between March 2017 and May 2018 in nine separate incidences. Five spillages occurred at Konza between KM391 and 395KM resulting in a loss of 3.805 million litres in what the management attributed to corrosion of the 40-year-old pipeline. “The corporation says the line is 15 years beyond its replacement date. In what is perhaps the greatest challenge for KPC, fuel within the pipeline travels at a speed of 13,000 liters per minute or 800,000 litres per hour when in live operation and pressures up 40 bars. This means that in case of a burst, KPC risks losing millions of fuel in split seconds. “We have seen arguments that there is no convincing evidence of spillage. But we must always remember that fuel is volatile and will easily evaporate,” a source at KPC said. Read: The company established that it lost 4.49 million liters through theft at Koru near Kisumu where illegal connections were expertly done by the perpetrators. KPC said there was an underground network of pipes connecting to an above-ground tank as well as fuel station underground tanks. “The operation was difficult to detect because the trucks loaded at the fuel service station in the neighborhood,” the company concluded. Two suspects in the Koru pilferage were nabbed and charged on 15 November 2017. In May this year, KPC says it lost 1.2 million liters of fuel at Ngong Forest in another illegal connection but no suspect has been arrested so far. KPC also lost 1.151 million liters at KM40 and KM 27 which they attributer to corrosiveness of the pipes due to high soil salinity. KPC moves in excess of 13billion litres during the two-year period on behalf of the oil marketers. KPC documents indicate that there was a book balance and physical stock differential of approximately 23 Million litres which, at Sh100 per litre including taxes, would make the 2.3 billion litres loss quoted by a local daily. “If you add all the operational costs, line product theft plus the oil spillage you will get to the 23 million litres,” a source claimed, disputing the alleged scandal. Absolving the management, the report states: “The spillages mainly due to old age of the pipeline were not entirely unexpected bearing in mind the age of the pipeline, wear and tear, and topography of some sections through which the pipeline traverses, whose soil accelerates corrosion thus causing pipeline burst and spillages.” Also Read:",https://the-star.co.ke/news/2018-11-28-boardroom-tussles-rock-kenya-pipeline/
7,True,True,9.0,Kagweni Micheni,22 November 2018 - 00:15,,[VIDEO] Harsh realities behind the moral debate on abortion,,"In a dark, nondescript room, the walls caked in spots and smears whose origins she would rather not think about, a young girl sits wringing her hands, waiting for the woman she had been told could help her. She takes one deep breath after another, telling herself it will be okay, there is no other option, she has to be there. Eventually the door slowly starts to open, bathing the room in light that does nothing other than illuminate the dilapidated hospital bed in the corner. “You, lie over there!” The order is barked to her by the disinterested newcomer. She does not seem to notice the scared girl, frozen to her seat. She cannot see the terror in the young girl’s eyes, or the desperate need for reassurance that she is making the right choice. To the woman, this girl is one of many who pass through her door. Nothing more than a chance to make a few thousand shillings. “Lie down!” This time the girl slowly makes her way to the bed, and she soon finds herself on her back, looking up at the dark ceiling with its broken fan and single light bulb swaying. She tries to concentrate on that, the swinging of the bulb. Back and forth, back and forth. Maybe if she pays attention to that, she won’t have to think about what is about to happen to her. Out of the corner of her eye, the girl notices a new person entering the room. Suddenly, her legs have been spread and pinned down. A clammy hand is clamped over her mouth and it begins. “She used a hanger on me. Someone was holding my legs down so I couldn’t move, then they put it inside me. I remember screaming and screaming so much I couldn’t breath. I won’t forget that pain, not for as long as I live,” she later recalls. DEADLY OPERATION As the girl lies in bed, her mattress slowly soaking in blood, clutching her stomach as shooting pains render her immobile, she knows she’s one of the lucky ones. While she prays for the pain to end, she knows girls who didn’t wake up. “I know it was dangerous. I know a girl who died when she bled too much. Her mother found her. I knew all this. But I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have anyone to turn to, it is what it is.” When I asked her if she would do it again, knowing now exactly what she would have to experience, her answer was quick and to the point. “Yes.” The World Health Organisation has found that Middle and Eastern Africa have the highest global rate of unsafe abortions at 36 per 1,000 women. In Kenya, unsafe abortions are one of the major causes of maternal deaths. “An unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy, either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards or both,” says Dr Caroline Tatua, a senior health systems adviser. Every year, 2,600 women die from unsafe abortions. That’s seven women dying daily, accounting for 35 per cent of maternal mortality. The global rate is 13 per cent. Women and girls are dying every day, whether it’s because of the stigma surrounding abortions, a lack of information or not knowing your rights. MARIE STOPES ON THE SPOT In Kenya under the 2010 Constitution, abortions are not permitted unless in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is a need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law. On Friday, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board caused a stir when it banned international group Marie Stopes from offering abortion services. Marie Stopes has been the stop for many who seek to undo unplanned pregnancies. It has operated in Kenya since 1985, and has set up 22 clinics and 15 mobile outreach clinics. KMPDB boss Daniel Yumbya said: “Marie Stopes Kenya is hereby directed to immediately cease and desist offering any form of abortion services in all its facilities within the republic of Kenya.” The move came after the Kenya Film Classification Board ordered the clinic to pull down radio and online advertisements they alleged promoted abortions. Marie Stopes deferred comment on the matter when reached for response. However, it says on its website that it operates within the law: “We offer counselling services, including post-abortion care, to reduce the risks of any woman experiencing problems after a miscarriage or unsafe abortion procedure.” The clinic further says it offers surgical abortion, which is safe and may be used to terminate a pregnancy at various stages of gestation. Its slogans include “ Children by Choice not Chance ” and “ Helping You Manage Your Options ” . There is a fear that by stopping Marie Stopes from providing a service that is so desperately needed, the KMPDB is condemning thousands of women and girls to unsafe abortions, leading to complications, infections and deaths. But what would happen if Marie Stopes didn’t exist? What if the organisation had not set up a base in Kenya to provide not only reproductive health services but abortion services, too? IMPACT OF BAN Approximately 464,000 abortions are conducted each year. Last year, Marie Stopes averted 208,979 unsafe abortions. If they were not there, if just 40 per cent of that number chose to have an unsafe abortion, that leaves 83,592 women who have put their lives at risk. Of that number, if only five per cent died, that would be 4,180 women. Since abortions have only been permitted since 2010, that would be 29,258 women dead since that time. On top of the loss in life, financially, the healthcare system would seriously be impacted. According to the Health ministry and the African Population and Health Research Centre, Kenya has spent Sh533 million treating complications of unsafe abortions in public health facilities. Those are millions of shillings that are desperately needed in a system that is already heavily burdened, and a cost that would only increase as more and more women are driven to quack doctors. Doctors who would use crude, unhygienic methods with no thought to aftercare. Choosing to have an abortion is more than deciding to have the procedure. There are a number of psychological demands on the body that must also be met. Psychologically, women, and in particular young girls, can be severely affected and, therefore, need to have someone they can talk to. By removing access to trained professionals who can counsel these women, the KMPDB is arguably denying them the chance to truly heal from the experience. That said, abortion is an extremely divisive topic in a country ruled largely by religious and moral beliefs. C ounsellor Patrick Masiga told the Star he does not approve of it. He said although he believes there is safe abortion supported by the Constitution, he has received many cases of young girls who regret this dire decision. “Everything happens for a reason. Even those who go through the pain of rape should not undergo abortion because that child is innocent. Abortion leaves a scar for many of these women,” he said. On the other hand, one of the main reasons women choose to go the illegal, dangerous route of backstreet abortions is that they are unable to have open, honest conversations about it. What this ban has done is say that anyone brave enough to highlight the subject, or even mention it in any way, will be met with opposition at the highest level. It vilifies a service that is desperately needed to save lives, and drives women and girls to the seedy underworld of unsafe abortions. One thing that was made clear while talking to people on the streets about abortions is that while some may have been staunchly against it, every single person talked to either knew someone who had had an unsafe abortion, or knew where to take someone if need be. Stopping Marie Stopes from providing abortions services will not stop abortions from happening in Kenya. But it will increase the number of women seeking unsafe abortions. And it will continue to kill our women. Additional reporting by Melanie Mwangi",https://the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-11-22-video-harsh-realities-behind-the-moral-debate-on-abortion/

Speaking yesterday in Nairobi at the launch of United Nations Population Fund’s 2012 State of the World report, Planning PS Edward Sambili asked the public health sector to improve its facilities to enable them address its needs. Sambili said family planning will help reduce abortions, which currently stand at 300,000. In a speech read on his behalf by the director of administration, John Nandasaba, Sambili attributed the skyrocketing poverty indices to reluctance by Kenyans to use contraceptives. “Unplanned pregnancies are reversing the economic gains being made, while contributing to the rising cases of abortions,” Sambili said. According to the report, whose theme is Family Planning, Human Rights and Development, one in every four women would like to delay or stop child bearing but do not use any family planning methods. The report calls for measures that will increase the uptake of family planning services to the 15-24 age group, which is hardest hit. It recommends the provision of knowledge and improvement of access to geographical regions that have difficulties in acquiring family planning services. The report appeals for an uptake of contraceptives to lower the current fertility rate from 4.6 per cent to two per cent. “We need to increase access to FP services so that women and couples who need them can enjoy their benefits,” said Eliud Wekesa, a lead researcher from the University of Nairobi. If not checked, Kenya’s population, currently at 40 million, is predicted to soar to 64 million in 2030. The National Council for Population and Development CEO Boniface K’Oyugi reiterated the need to manage the population, saying it will play a critical role in realising the Kenya Vision 2030 goals. “We hope to achieve the goal of two children per household in 2050 if we encourage the public to embrace the use of contraceptives,” K’Oyugi said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2012-11-14-use-family-planning-methods-sambili-urges/

Respondents said 35 per cent of land they know to have been grabbed belonged to schools followed by communal land (29 per cent) and agricultural land (10 per cent). The survey shows overall, 15 per cent of Kenyans are aware of land that was previously public but has been ‘grabbed’ for private use.

Wanjiru told investigators that the caller, who hid the mobile phone number, warned her of dire consequences if she failed to procure an abortion. She said the caller was not the MP and that he identified himself as a member of the Mungiki sect. She said that the the same day, Wakapee had sent her Sh20,000 through Mpesa for the abortion but she declined. “The following day Francis called me and ordered me to find a doctor and when I had done so I should get him to come and pay for the termination of the pregnancy,” Wanjiru said. “Since that time we have argued over the issue on the phone, but it's an SMS which scared me most because he [the sender] told me he would send Mungiki to deal with me if I refused what he had told me,” Wanjiru said in the statement to investigators. Yesterday, Wanjiru in an interview with the Star maintained that she would not abort but was determined to have the MP take care of their baby once she gives birth next January. Wanjiru said she was forced to move out of her house after she started receiving the death threats. Wanjiru recorded the two-page statement at the Kasarani CID offices on Tuesday, detailing her 13-month secret love life with the MP. She revealed that she met the MP for the first time in July last year, at a bus stop on Thika Road as she was heading home. She said Wakapee, who was driving in a Toyota Prado, stopped at the bus stop and introduced himself as a doctor from Kenyatta National Hospital. They exchanged numbers and that marked the beginning of their relationship during which the MP promised to marry Wanjiru as a second wife. She said her lover promised to visit her rural home in Othaya in November to meet his near-future in-laws, but this seems to have hit a brick wall when Wanjiru announced that she was pregnant. She said that the MP made her relocate from Umoja to Thika Road and also promised to start a business for her. Yesterday, the MP was unavailable to comment.

If not fought with a vengeance, corruption might become the fourth arm of the government, he said. The three arms of government are the executive, judiciary and legislature. The CJ spoke at All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi, at an event marking five years since the constitution was promulgated on August 27, 2010. He called on the mainstream church to play an active role in fighting graft. “Corruption is a form of terrorism. What is the need of getting a good constitution that does not benefit its people?” Mutunga said. He said corruption kills generations as counterfeit drugs and other illegal commodities destroy lives. “I was in Nigeria recently and its army was supplied with counterfeit bullet-proof vests. When they were in the battlefield fighting Boko Haram, many were killed because of the fake vests.” Mutunga urged the church to join the war on graft, saying corruption is a sin. “The judiciary is engaged in a mighty fight against corruption and the church must support us, for to fail in that fight will be to fail God and fail the constitution.” The CJ took a swipe on churches, saying they must fight graft in their own ranks and surgically remove religious bandits preying on frustration and hopelessness. Mutunga said the constitution has been a boon to Kenyans and without it, the country would not have had a peaceful election. He dismissed claims by the clergy the constitution promotes abortions and that sharia law would be introduced through the Kadhis Court. There was a minute of silence for those who fought for the constitution.

Joseph Njuguna said he, not Juja MP Francis Waititu, made 25-year-old Martha Wanjiru pregnant, contrary to her allegations. Njuguna, who spoke to the Star on the phone, said he had been living in the same house with Wanjiru until three weeks ago, when she left after a disagreement. Njuguna claimed that Wanjiru became pregnant while in his house in Githurai 44, and that she had informed him that he was the father of the unborn baby. Wanjiru denied the claims by Njuguna last night and dismissed him as a jilted lover who did not wish her well. “It is not true. The man wanted to marry me, but I refused. I did not have an intimate relationship with him,” said Wanjiru. But Njuguna insisted that he is responsible for her pregnancy. He also distanced himself from social media comments that he was doing a hatchet job on behalf of some Kiambu politicians who wanted to discredit Wanjiru. Asked what his intention was, Njuguna said: “I feel bad that she has tarnished the MP’s name. She told me that I am the father of the child and I have been supporting her financially until now. “I only want the truth to be known.” Njuguna said he had been living in the same rented house with Wanjiru since March and had planned to marry her until three weeks ago, when they parted ways. Njuguna claimed that he told Wanjiru to leave his house after he learnt from her friends that she had a five-year-old son who was in her rural home in Othaya. “I did not want to marry a lady who had a child. And because I could not establish the truth about her, we parted ways,” Njuguna said. On Tuesday, the M-pesa attendant told Kasarani police that she became pregnant after a 13-month relationship with the MP popularly known as Wakapee.

The church does not recognise divorce, teaching that marriage is lifetime commitment. In order to separate, Catholics must have their marriage annulled by showing it was flawed from the outset. The reforms allow access to procedures free of charge and fast-track decisions. Until now the procedures have been seen as arcane, expensive and bureaucratic. Catholics seeking an annulment previously needed approval from two church tribunals. The reforms has reduced this to one, although appeals will still be allowed. Yesterday, the Catholic Church in Kenya welcomed the Pope’s decision. In the church teaching, abortion is such a grave sin that those who procure are automatically excommunicated, which can only be lifted by designated clerical officials. However, from December 8 to November 26, during an extraordinary Holy Year or Jubilee on the theme of mercy, all priests will be able to lift the excommunication if the women repent “with a contrite heart”, the Pope said in a letter published by the Vatican last Tuesday.

KPL Governing Council has unanimously confirmed that the Kenyan Premier League will have 16 teams in 2015 and will only consider proposals to reduce them in later years. “The number of teams in KPL is also no longer negotiable because of the blatant bad faith by FKF in the recent discussions with Fifa and KPL. For example, FKF leaked confidential documents and repeatedly provided inaccurate and biased information which so flagrantly misrepresented the discussions that even the Fifa officials complained,” said a statement from the KPL-GC posted on the KPL official portal. KPL also revealed that the joint executive committee meeting between them an FKF that was to be held yesterday aborted. “Yesterday the FKF president Sam Nyamweya personally promised the KPL chairman that he would hand over a copy of the Fifa independent expert consultant’s report before the start of the JEC meeting this morning.

Over the next few days, FKF continued discussions with KPL without disclosing that they had received the Fifa letter and report.

She was reported missing at Ongata Rongai police station the next day. Her neighbours said her phone went off around 10pm the day she left her home.

36,True,True,0.0,REUTERS,02 February 2016 - 15:00,,From abortions to #condommania: Kenyan students get real about sex,,"Desperate female students used to knock on Catherine Tweni's door almost every day, needing emergency treatment for self-administered abortions. Tweni, a nurse at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, 35 km (22 miles) from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, often had to rush them to the operating theatre. ""Most of them used to come bleeding which was dangerous... maybe going into shock because of incomplete abortion,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Abortion is rarely available in public hospitals in Kenya and many women do not know how to access a safe abortion. Young women who wanted to terminate pregnancies used to buy pills over the counter in pharmacies, Tweni said. ""They were told: 'When you start bleeding, rush to the hospital',"" she said, standing in the campus's leafy grounds. Misoprostol, which causes contractions of the womb, can be used for pregnancies up to 12 weeks. It is supposed to be taken with medical supervision in case of complications. But the number of young women at the university seeking help for DIY abortions has fallen dramatically, Tweni said, since the introduction of a new sex education club two years ago. Pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections have also dropped, she said, while the number of students coming for contraceptives has risen to 20 to 50 a month from one or two. Some 3,500 students at JKUAT have taken part in the Brighter Futures club, which encourages them to write life plans with weekly discussions ranging from careers and relationships to health and finance. ""It's just so fun,"" said Lilian Mutheu, 20, who is studying construction management. ""You are told about money matters, how to know your values, your personality and setting life goals."" After writing a life plan, she stopped hanging out with ""bad friends"" who encouraged her to skip classes and drink alcohol. Students also receive a booklet explaining the pros and cons of condoms versus pills, injectible contraceptives and implants. ""We try to demystify the various methods,"" said one of the club leaders, 23 year-old Felicity Karimi, explaining that many girls believed contraceptives would make them infertile. In conservative Kenya, parents and teachers rarely discuss sex openly with teenagers, leaving them to glean information from friends, the media and the internet. There was uproar over plans in 2014 to introduce comprehensive sex education in schools, with critics charging it would encourage immorality. One-quarter of sexually active Kenyan women have an unmet need for family planning, 2014 government data shows, and one in five girls aged 15 to 19 are pregnant or mothers. ""Sex is there,"" said JKUAT's Dean of Students Emmah Omulokoli. ""Whether you talk about it or not, it is going on among young people."" Almost two-thirds of students at JKUAT say they are sexually active, according to research by Jhpiego, a charity affiliated with the John Hopkins University in the United States which is supporting the club. ""This is not a family planning programme,"" said Jhpiego's project leader Manya Dotson. ""This is a programme about helping young people get excited about their futures... and then thinking about what are the realistic things that might get in the way of that."" One year after the club began, the percentage of sexually active students at JKUAT using a modern contraceptive increased to 72 percent from 52 percent, Jhpiego said. There are plans to introduce the club in almost 30 other universities across Kenya. Kinyua Charles Karuri, 21, picks up free condoms from the campus hospital with a gang of friends. ""I come with my boys,"" he said. ""It boosts your confidence."" At the club, they played a game called #condommania where different groups race to put a condom on a plastic model. ""It's a good game. It's like an icebreaker,"" he said. ""It turns us into professional guys during sex."" The club is not without its detractors. The Christian Union is a powerful force on campus, as many students come from religious homes where they learn that premarital sex is a sin. ""According to them, the church is teaching us not to have sex outside marriage and I am advocating for the opposite,"" said club leader Karimi. ""We are not telling the students to have sex. We are just telling them if they decide to have sex, there are options that can ensure that they have safe sex.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016-02-02-from-abortions-to-condommania-kenyan-students-get-real-about-sex/

The consignment, which included 18 containers of contraband sugar from Brazil, 49 containers of rice and 63 of ethanol, was seized in several Container Freight Stations. The ethanol was valued at Sh288 million while the sugar's total value stood at Sh56 million. The CFSs – Autoports, Portside and Compact – are owned by the family of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. But importers have threatened to move to court to challenge the police's move to close the stations, even after a court had allowed reopening on Tuesday. The ethanol and sugar were impounded at Autoports on January 15 by officers from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and KRA. An earlier destruction plan in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Mwakirunge dumpsite aborted after KRA resolved to destroy the products out at sea. KRA officials emptied 450 tonnes of sugar and 1,225 tonnes of rice into a barge. A single 40-foot container has a capacity of 25 tonnes of sugar or rice packed in 50Kg bags. The ethanol was also poured into the sea. KRA Commissioner of Customs Julius Musyoki clarified that the rice consignment was not an illicit cargo. “The rice consignment consists of cargo initially destined for Uganda, but whose owner failed to claim it. The goods were condemned by the Kenya Bureau of Standards as unfit for human consumption,” said Musyoki. He said KRA will continue enforcing the law against illicit trade by closing stations and prosecuting owners and managers. Last Thursday, KRA closed down the two freight stations for holding contraband, but the paramilitary GSU moved in and shut them down again on Tuesday shortly after reopening. Musyoki declined to comment about the closure saying, “a detailed comprehensive report will be prepared and released to the public later”. Autoports operations manager Salim Juma said they have been told to resume operations today. “We are waiting for a written confirmation to resume full operations,” he said. He said the presence of the heavily armed officers on Tuesday afternoon caused fear among staff who will now report today.

Cruz received 35.2 percent of support to Trump's 39.5 percent, the poll of 568 Republicans taken April 1-5 found. The numbers put the two within the poll's 4.8 percentage-point credibility interval, a measure of accuracy. Cruz and Trump were also briefly in a dead heat on March 28. The U.S. senator from Texas was running ahead of Trump in Wisconsin according to opinion polls as voters in the state went to the polls on Tuesday. Cruz hopes a win in Wisconsin would show he can unite disparate factions of the party and break Trump's momentum. Trump has led almost continually in national Reuters/Ipsos polling since last July. Ohio Governor John Kasich, the only other Republican still in the race for the party's nomination, placed third in Tuesday's Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 18.7 percent. Facing possible defeat in Wisconsin on Tuesday, Trump proposed blocking money transfers to Mexico by undocumented immigrants as a way to pressure Mexico to pay for a border wall, a key component of his controversial immigration plan, which has won votes in other states. Trump's campaign said in a memo that if elected, he would use a U.S. anti-terrorism law to cut off remittances from people living in the United States illegally. The memo elaborated on an idea Trump floated in August, when he suggested seizing all remittances tied to ""illegal wages.""

""The notion that we're going to track every Western Union bit of money that's being sent to Mexico, good luck with that,” Obama said at a White House press briefing. Cruz's support in Reuters/Ipsos polling rose as Trump's wavered, particularly among women, after recent missteps. Trump said in a March 30 interview that if abortion was illegal, women who end pregnancies could face punishment. He later reversed himself to say doctors who provide abortions should be held responsible. More than 70 percent of likely women voters said they had an ""unfavorable"" opinion of Trump, according to a rolling poll average for the five-day period ended April 5. In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a slender lead in opinion polls in Wisconsin over front-runner Hillary Clinton, but she maintained her lead nationally in a Reuters/Ipsos poll also released on Tuesday.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016-04-06-republican-presidential-hopeful-cruz-in-national-dead-heat-with-trump/

Hundreds of Kapsabet town residents had converged at Kipchoge Keino Stadium for the midday prayers but drunk youths stormed in and stopped the proceedings. The youths, some carrying twigs, claimed they were not involved in the planning of the meeting. They said the county government hurriedly organised it to celebrate the ICC verdict. Governor Cleophas Lagat, woman representative Zipporah Kering, assembly speaker Edwin Cheluget and a number of MCAs were present. Lagat watched in disbelief as the chaos erupted, with the youths grabbing each other by the neck and threatening to pull down tents that had been erected for the prayers. Pandemonium broke loose when the prayer was turned into a supremacy battle between elected leaders and those eyeing their positions. Rev Peter Rono of Kapsabet Pentecostal Church, who was expected to preside over the prayers, stormed off with his Bible claiming the meeting had been hijacked by hooligans. Others who left the venue in a huff included Nandi council of elders chairman Benjamin Kitur and MCAs Wilson Sang (Chepkumia), Hillary Koiyon, (Kipken) and Joseph Toon (Chemundu). Another group, which had been ferried from Nandi Hills, demanded to be addressed by JAP activist David Sum. The move incensed other groups who disrupted his address, prompting Kering to join her supporters in singing the DP's praises. Efforts by Cheluget and Kering to cool down the groups failed. The governor addressed the agitated residents, declaring the prayers had been called off until a later date. He told the meeting that the “forces of darkness” who had planned to have Ruto and Sang jailed at the ICC had been defeated and that they should now be firm in JAP.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016-04-06-rowdy-youth-disrupt-ruto-sang-thanksgiving-meeting-in-kapsabet/

The tribunal could not proceed with its hearing because Judge Tunoi’s lawyer Fred Ngatia was not available as he was appearing before the Appeal Court in the matter in which the judge is challenging his retirement at age 70. Ngatia was supposed to cross-examine the judge’s accuser, journalist Geoffrey Kiplagat, who had already given his evidence in private on Tuesday. He made the bribery claims against the judge in an affidavit in November 2014. Kiplagat said he facilitated payment of the bribe but never received the Sh30 million facilitation fee he had been promised. However, there is no direct evidence to prove that any money exchanged hands. The tribunal is chaired by Sharad Rao. Other members are Justice Roseline Korir, retired judge Jonathan Havelock and lawyers Judith Guserwa, James Gacoka, Abdirashid Hussein and George Wakukha. Meanwhile, judge Tunoi’s retirement case was also put off. The case was postponed after new counsel was appointed by the judge to represent him. The hearing date will be fixed today. Lawyer Kimani Kiragu, who has taken over the case from senior counsel Pheroze Nowrojee, said Tunoi hired him on Wednesday and he needs to familiarise himself with the case.

45,True,True,1.0,REUTERS,28 April 2016 - 03:00,,Republican Cruz names Fiorina as running mate,,"U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, in a last-ditch bid to slow front-runner Donald Trump's momentum, on Wednesday named former business executive Carly Fiorina to be his vice presidential running mate if he wins the nomination. After suffering a series of crushing losses to Trump in nominating contests on Tuesday, Cruz praised Fiorina as a principled fighter for conservative values who knew how to create jobs and would be a valuable ally on the campaign trail. ""She is careful. She is measured. She is serious,"" Cruz said. ""She doesn't get rattled."" Fiorina, 61, dropped her own White House bid in February after a lackluster seventh-place finish in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. She endorsed Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas, a month later and has been a sharp critic on the campaign trail of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Cruz's unusually early announcement of a running mate appeared to be a bid to recover from Tuesday's losses, which moved Trump closer to the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination at the July 18-21 Republican convention in Cleveland. The nominee will face the Democrats' pick in November's general election. Traditionally, the winners of the Republican and Democratic presidential races announce their running mates in the period between clinching the nomination and the summer national conventions. But Cruz needs help after Tuesday's drubbing by Trump, 69, in all five Northeastern states that held primary elections: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The choice of Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard Co chief executive who, like Trump, has never held elective office, could help Cruz with women voters, a group that Trump has had difficulty winning over to his outsider campaign. It also could offer Cruz a boost in the June 7 primary in California, where in 2010 Fiorina won the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. She was defeated in the subsequent general election by incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. 'WASTE OF TIME' In a statement, Trump was scornful of Cruz's decision to pick a running mate, calling it ""a pure waste of time"" and ""a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all-talk, no-action politician."" ""Cruz has no path to victory. He is only trying to stay relevant,"" the New York billionaire and former reality TV star said. Trump and Fiorina tangled on the campaign trail during her White House race. After Trump insulted her looks in an interview - ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?"" - she sternly rebuked him in a debate. ""I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,"" Fiorina said last September. A breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction, Fiorina served as Hewlett-Packard CEO from 1999 to 2005. She was forced to resign amid weak earnings as the company struggled to digest a $19 billion merger with then-rival Compaq Computer Corp. Her campaign never took off in the original, crowded 17-member Republican presidential field, and she was mostly relegated to the early second-tier debates for low-polling candidates. Some conservatives applauded the choice. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect political candidates who oppose abortion rights, said Fiorina was the ""ideal"" choice. ""She will take Hillary Clinton head-on,"" Dannenfelser said in a statement. If she is nominated, Fiorina would become the third woman to win a major-party vice presidential nomination. She would follow Geraldine Ferraro, who ran with Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984, and Sarah Palin, who ran with Republican John McCain in 2008. Both tickets lost in the general election. Clinton would be the first woman to be the presidential nominee of a major party.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016-04-28-republican-cruz-names-fiorina-as-running-mate/

The residents of Keringet chased away the officers who had arrived at the area in Jubilee branded cars, saying they don't want to hear anything to do with the DP.

The flip side of judiciary interviews",,"For more than a month, interviews for Chief Justice and Deputy Chief have been serious, probing and at times ponderous. Twenty-nine candidates were asked how to improve the image of the judiciary. They were quizzed on their judicial philosophy, past controversial rulings, integrity issues, the backlog of cases, what to do about corruption and how to handle presidential petitions. Polygamy, traditional conflict resolution, inheritance, maintenance for men, abortion and homosexuality also featured. Then on Wednesday there was laughter. JSC member Winifred Guchu abruptly asked two candidates for Supreme Court judge which animal they would like to be if they lived in the wild. Interviewers and applicants were caught by surprise. She also asked which animals they don’t like. There were an elephant, a lion and two cats. Hyenas and rats were despised. 'Elephant in the court room' Lenaola Justice Isaac Lenaola would be an elephant. Lenaola who heads the Human Rights Division at the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi, praised the jumbo's intelligence. “Apart from intelligence, the enormous animal is always calm,” Lenaola said. He is also deputy presiding judge of the East African Community court. He'd be the elephant in the courtroom. They say an elephant never forgets. Candidates Imaana Laibuta and John Chebii (both scholars) would be cats. Laibuta said: ""A cat is loving and enjoys the warmth of everyone in a home."" ""I love the cat because of its loving nature,"" Laibuta, who is physically challenged, said. Nice, but do we want warm and fuzzy loving judges? Chebii said a cat is “patient, calm and cautious. A cat approaches issues calmly,"" Chebii, a lecturer at Moi University, said. Of course, cats are also notoriously independent free-thinkers, qualities much in demand. Kimaru does not like rats On Thursday, Guchu asked High Court judges Luka Kimaru and Joseph Sergon the opposite. Which animals would they not want to be? Kimaru said: “I detest a rat, it’s nuisance at home.” No surprise there. He has likely encountered quite a few in courtrooms as well. ""It doesn't have attributes a human being likes,"" said Kimaru, head of the Criminal Appeals Commission in Milimani. Sergon said he doesn’t like hyenas “since they are lazy. ""They wait for other animals to struggle and make a kill before eating leftovers,” he said. Definitely not desirable qualities, but Sergon has undoubtedly encountered quite a few in and outside the judiciary. He does like lions, though. Strong and, noble but also predators. Oddball questions revealing Why are “fun” or weird questions asked in job interviews? In an interview yesterday, Guchu told the Star these questions shed light on the personality of the applicant. Asking the right questions is an interviewing skill that works in a panel, she said. ""It's a way of assessment,"" Guchu said, adding she couldn't comment on the cats, elephant, lion, rat and hyena, as interviews are ongoing. Which animal would she choose to be? We don't know yet. The menagerie may expand as the interviews continue next week. Human Resources experts say unusual, out-of-the-blue questions enable them to judge thoughtfulness, imagination, humour and ability to think fast, clearly and score points. ""All the time there are direct, serious questions and people have prepped, they're prepared with serious answers,"" one HR expert at a Nairobi media company says. ""But all questions have a purpose,"" she adds, ""and an unexpected question might catch someone off-guard and their answers might reveal something about their true self."" According to , there are no right or wrong answers. But the way you handle strange questions is very important. ""Fun interview questions test a number of things, your ability to think on your feet, creativity, ability to remain calm and considered and how you react to the unexpected,"" it says. These questions can also break the ice, get people to relax and keep the discussion going. ""Acknowledge funny interview questions with a smile and pause to collect your thoughts before answering,"" the website advises. It lists several funny questions that could have illuminating answers.

Trump 's refusal, which his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton called ""horrifying,"" was the standout remark of the their third and final debate and ratcheted up claims he has made for weeks that the election was rigged against him. Asked by moderator Chris Wallace whether Trump would not commit to a peaceful transition of power, the businessman-turned-politician replied: ""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. Ok?"" Trump 's statement may appeal to his anti-establishment followers, but it was unlikely to reverse opinion polls that show him losing, including in key states that will decide the election. ""That is not the way our democracy works,"" Clinton said during the debate. ""We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election."" Later she told reporters: ""What he said tonight is part of his whole effort to blame somebody else for where he is in his campaign."" A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 per cent thought Clinton, the former US secretary of state, won the debate while 39 per cent said Trump , making his first run at public office, was the victor. Mexico's peso currency, seen as a measure of Trump 's prospects, rose to its highest level in six weeks at the end of the debate, suggesting growing investor confidence of a Clinton victory. Trump has vowed to build a wall on the border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and has said he would make Mexico pay for it. Republicans voice concern Mainstream Republicans were quick to denounce the comment. US Senator Lindsey Graham, a former Republican presidential candidate who has never warmed to Trump , said: ""If he loses, it will not be because the system is 'rigged' but because he failed as a candidate."" Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who also ran for the Republican presidential nomination and now supports Trump , defended him. He said Trump 's message was that ""if there's some kind of obvious fraud going on, he's going to say something about it."" ""He didn't say he wouldn't accept it,"" Carson told Reuters. ""He said he would evaluate it at the time."" Trump 's running mate, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, said Trump ""will accept the outcome"" because he is going to win. But Republican strategist Ryan Williams found Trump 's statement ""deeply concerning."" ""You have to accept the results of the election unless there are grounds for a recount and at this point it does not appear that we're heading for a close election,"" he said. 'A nasty women' In a debate that for the first time focused more on policy than character, the two candidates nonetheless lashed out at each other. Trump , 70, called Clinton ""such a nasty woman,"" accused her campaign of orchestrating a series of accusations by women who said the businessman made unwanted sexual advances and said that both she and President Barack Obama were behind disturbances at his rallies. He said the Clinton Foundation was a criminal enterprise and as a result she should not have been allowed to seek the presidency. Clinton, 68, said Trump himself had incited violence, belittled women and posed a danger to the United States. She said Trump , a former reality TV star, had in the past also complained that his show was unjustly denied a US television Emmy award. ""I should have gotten it,"" Trump retorted. Trump said all of the stories of sexual misdeeds were ""totally false"" and suggested Clinton was behind the charges. He called her campaign ""sleazy"" and said, ""Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody."" Clinton said the women came forward after Trump said in the last debate he had never made unwanted advances on women. In a 2005 video, Trump was recorded bragging about groping women against their will. ""Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like,"" said Clinton, the first woman to win the nomination of a major US political party. The two candidates also had a spirited exchange on abortion, gun rights and immigration during the showdown. Clinton said she would raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund the US government's Social Security retirement program. She said Trump , who Forbes says is worth $3.7 billion, would be paying higher taxes too unless he can get out of it. ""Such a nasty woman,"" Trump said. Trump and Clinton battled sharply over the influence of Vladimir Putin, with Clinton calling Trump the Russian president's puppet and Trump charging Putin had repeatedly outsmarted Clinton. Clinton and Trump walked straight to their podiums when they were introduced at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, once again forgoing the traditional handshake as they did at the second debate last week in St. Louis, Missouri.

The World Anti-Doping Agency said many athletes who had been targeted for testing ""simply could not be found"". It added that on some days ""up to 50 per cent of tests were aborted"". Its 55-page found that of the 11,470 athletes, 4,125 had no record of any testing in 2016,. Some 1,913 of them were competing in 10 ""higher-risk sports"". The report further said that nearly 100 samples were not matched to an athlete because of data entry errors and one missing sample was not located until two weeks after the Game. According to wada, t here was no out-of-competition testing conducted in football, which Wada found ""surprising"" with almost 500 fewer tests conducted than organisers had planned during the Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is ultimately responsible for delivering the anti-doping programme for the Olympic Games. Read: Wada mentioned several ""failings"" which led to inadequate support for the chaperones employed to notify athletes of testing. It said that on several occasions more than half of these failed to turn up, or turned up very late. It said they were ""disincentivised"" because of a lack of training, poor travel arrangements, and the fact many could not speak English. It said that, for ""the majority of times"" the 'no-notice' nature of testing was ""obviously compromised"" because chaperones did not know where athletes were and had to ask their team-mates where they were. In one of its recommendations, it said: ""Untrained and inexperienced chaperones should not be working at the Games. ""It undermines respect and trust among athletes in the anti-doping programme, and provides opportunities for experienced and unscrupulous athletes who would want to abuse the system to manipulate the doping control process."" But Wada did praise improvements made to Rio's anti-doping laboratory. The organisation had suspended the lab just six weeks before the Games opened, because it failed to comply with international standards. Read: Also read: But Wada said it had been ""superbly equipped"", and was ""operated very securely and generally very efficiently"". It said it now represents an ""outstanding legacy from the Games for the anti-doping movement in South America"". A statement on the IOC's website quoted Dr Richard Budgett, the IOC's medical and scientific director, saying the report ""shows that it was a successful Olympic Games with a successful anti-doping programme"". He added that the integrity of the programme had been ""ensured despite some challenges"". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Sir Craig Reedie, president of Wada, said that the logistical problems highlighted were disappointing. ""What was a real problem was the sample collection,"" he said, ""and there were number of major issues in Brazil, one was the lack of money and the other lack of manpower and some of that worked its way through to the sample collection process. ""In general the integrity of the process was not undermined according to the report."" Reedie said the doping programme had been well planned but let down by unforeseen circumstances.

The unidentified man was arrested after the woman developed complications from the concoctions she was given after the exercise on Sunday. Judy Moraa said she was referred to the herbalist by a friend who assured her that her two-month pregnancy would be terminated safely. She said from her hospital bed that the man c harged her Sh5,000 for the illegal operation but that she could only raise Sh2,000, which she gave as a down payment. Moraa said the abortion was conducted at a maize plantation at Michatha area onn the outskirts of Molo town. She said she bled profusely and felt weak before but was rescued by neighbours who heard her distress call. The woman said she decided to terminate the pregnancy as it would be difficult to raise a third child as a single mother. She got s eparated from her husband two years ago. ""I was stressed after realising I was expecting a third child while the second one is only a year old. I am jobless and needy,"" she said. Nakuru woman representative Mary Mbugua asked police to ensure the suspect is punished by law. ""It is a crime to commit such an act. We must stop such crimes with a force equal to that applied on those conducting female genital mutilation,"" she said.

""I know many of you are deeply disappointed by the results of the election. I am too, more than I can ever express,"" she said. ""But as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love, and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and big hearted.""

He did not refer to the MPs from both sides who threw punches — and even used pepper spray — on Tuesday night during a tempestuous session on amending electoral laws. It was aborted and the video feed cancelled so the public could not see the scrimmage. The same could happen today in two sittings. Jubilee is pushing for changes, the opposition says weakened laws will be used to rig the election. The President commented about idiots on Tuesday night, just hours after Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo was caught on camera hurling insults at him. ""On our left is the National Assembly representing democracy, but it has also given some idiots the ability to keep insulting me,"" Uhuru said as he presided over lighting the KICC for the festive season. Saying he was not legally elected, Odhiambo told Uhuru to stop harassing Kenyans with heavy-handed security, a cordon and water cannons around Parliament. ""I dedicated this day to telling the President all the negative things. Uhuru should start packing for his journey back to Gatundu as he is extremely stupid and a fake President, as his own backyard is poor,"" she said. Yesterday, the President hammered home the insults and idiots issue as he reopened the Volkswagen Kenya production line at Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers factory in Thika. ""They are looking for a wrong person with insults and intimidation. I have no time for confrontations. We will soldier on with our agenda for development because it’s even said frogs’ eyes cannot prevent cows from taking water,"" Uhuru said. He spoke as the IEBC and the Communication Authority of Kenya met MPs to fine-tune the controversial amendments that turned Parliament into a battleground. Expect turmoil today in sessions to wrap up business. Neither side has budged. Uhuru said, ""I won't stop nor be discouraged by noise and insults peddled by a few individuals because every market has its own mad man."" The opposition is trying to force a coalition government by sowing doubts and causing divisions and chaos about the election next August, Uhuru said. ""Kenyans are tired of retrogressive politics. Attempts to delay elections to get nusu mkate won't work. We want an election enabling Kenyans to form the government they want and nobody will prevent that,"" Uhuru said. He repeated the opposition has no agenda, adding it is best at insulting leaders and relying on intimidation instead of helping Kenyans. “We are on a mission to revive many industries so our youth can get employment opportunities,"" Uhuru said ""The other day we were in Webuye to open Pan Paper Mills and we will head to Eldoret to open RiverTex Company and many others countrywide,"" he said. The President was joined by Thika town MP Alice Ng’ang’a and Kiambu Governor William Kabogo. “We cannot allow a few people to dictate how things will be done. Kenyans must be given space to peacefully exercise their democratic rights,"" he said. Uhuru promised the election will be peaceful, transparent and open. He said the IEBC needs space and resources to oversee the polls. “We have an independent commission mandated to run elections and it will ensure all Kenyans elect chosen leaders calmly. Elections are for over 40 million, not a few people seeking to advance narrow selfish intentions by trying to cause chaos,” the President said. Jubilee supports the IEBC request for amendments to allow a manual voting alternative if electronic voter identification and results transmission fail. Cord says this will allow Jubilee to sneak in easy-to-manipulate manual voter identification and steal the election. The chaos on Tuesday forced National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to abruptly adjourn the session. Sources told the Star Muturi was forced to call two special sessions today after senior Jubilee officials gave him a dressing down over the tumult and failed session. He was criticised for giving the opposition leeway to interrupt and block amendments. Instead, Muturi extended the session for 55 minutes, in which the opposition raised points of order. The session aborted. After the violence, Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma urged Muturi to punish Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi for using pepper spray in his face.

62,True,True,5.0,THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION,24 January 2017 - 09:00,,Trump signs 'gag rule' restricting abortions worldwide,,"US President Donald Trump on Monday reinstated a global gag rule that bans US-funded groups around the world from discussing abortion, a move that was widely expected but nonetheless dismayed women's rights advocates. The rule, which affects American non-governmental organisations working abroad, is one that incoming presidents have used to signal their positions on abortion rights. It was created under US President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump , an abortion opponent, signed the reinstatement directive at a ceremony in the White House on his fourth day in office. Former President Barack Obama had lifted the gag rule in 2009 when he took office. ""Women's health and rights are now one of the first casualties of the Trump administration,"" said Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity in Washington. ""The global gag rule has been associated with an increase in unsafe abortions and we expect that Trump 's global gag rule will cost women their lives,"" she said. Reinstatement of the gag rule, formally the Mexico City policy, comes just two days after crowds of people marched in cities around the world in a show of unity for women's rights, among them abortion access. While no official estimates were available, organisers said nearly five million people participated. The far-reaching gag rule affects groups getting funding from the US Agency for International Development, even if they use separate money for abortion services, counseling or referrals, advocates note. ""It is appalling to dictate to civil society groups and health care providers how they can spend their own money and force them to withhold from women critical information about and access to the full range of reproductive health care,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the US-based Center for Reproductive Rights. The policy puts groups that provide women's health care in an ""untenable position,"" said Brian Dixon of Population Connection Action Fund. They can either accept the restriction to keep their funding or they can reject the restriction and lose their funding, Dixon said. ""Either choice hurts the women that rely on them."" Following the rule's inception in 1984, former President Bill Clinton revoked it when he took office in 1993 and former President George W Bush reinstated it in 2001. ""Life-saving global health funding should not be a political football,"" said Ann Starrs, head of the Guttmacher Institute, a leading reproductive rights group. There is no evidence the rule reduces abortion, she said. ""In fact, by targeting funding for overseas family planning programs, it may well have the opposite effect by making it harder for many women to avoid unintended pregnancy, which in turn would increase recourse to unsafe procedures by women who cannot access safe abortion care,"" she said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017-01-24-trump-signs-gag-rule-restricting-abortions-worldwide/

This means going for months with no email, no social media – you are basically cut off from the rest of the world. At this point, you begin to realise that Internet is far more than just a luxury and actually, many lives depend on it. Well, Bill Gates also believes many of the lives being lost unnecessarily to diseases and birth-related complications could be saved with affordable Internet access. Gates says his foundation currently uses SMS to reach rural Kenyan women with important health information, because these women have no Internet. The information include reminders for vaccination of their children or dates for family planning appointments. “Over time we hope to the 3G network is cheaper enough and our phones are popular enough that we can even use (mobile) applications,” he told the Star. Bill says the Foundation continues to track the 3G coverage map in Kenya and other countries. Currently, the foundation has made arrangements with service providers so that broadcast SMS carrying health messages do not attract premium charges. Bill granted interview with the Star and select African media houses after releasing his annual letter for 2017. He hopes Internet charges will come down significantly in the next five years, just like it happened in India. “What happens is that the way governments license the networks. They need to make sure the fees are very competitive. In the urban areas the cost of building those networks are quite low per user and therefore if you're asking companies to work in rural areas, are they subsidised to do that or do they charge a higher price?” he told the Star. In this year’s letter, Bill and his wife Melinda highlight their optimism about progress in global health. It is actually a response to a letter that Warren Buffet sent them on December 12 last year, asking about the effectiveness of his investment in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ten years ago. Bill Gates 2017 letter is a response to a letter (above) that Warren Buffet sent them on December 12 last year, asking about the effectiveness of his investment in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ten years ago. The couple explains that the money, together with their own donation, has saved the lives of 122 million children since 1990, through sustained reduction in childhood deaths. Most of the investment has been channeled to initiatives that benefit Africa, where most lives have also been saved. “Warren, your gift doubled the foundation’s resources. It’s allowed us to expand our work in US education, support small-holder farmers, and create financial services for the poor. But in this letter, we’re going to tell you about our work in global health—because that was the starting point of our philanthropy, and it’s the majority of what we do,” the letter says. Bill told the Star that some of these financial services for the poor have been implemented in Kenya, including saving schemes through Mpesa. “Use of mobile phones is advantageous not just for health but for many other things. Our foundation is involved in getting people to use Mpesa. We are also tracking how women using it. We are also encouraging women to save using that,” he said. Bill also noted the foundation is the biggest non-government donor to Global Fund, which funds most of HIV, TB, and Malaria treatment in Kenya. The letter carries a veiled reference to the Donald Trump's reinstatement of the rule that prohibits recipients of US foreign aid money to promote or provide abortion services. Health advocates say that rule threatens the Melinda Gates-led Family Planning 2020 partnership. The initiative aims to give 120 million more women across the world - including possibly millions of Kenyans - access to contraceptives by 2020. “Our letter is being released amid dramatic political transitions in these countries, including new leadership in the United States and the United Kingdom. We hope this story will remind everyone why foreign aid should remain a priority—because by lifting up the poorest, we express the highest values of our nations,” say the Gates in the introduction. “One of the greatest of those values is the belief that the best investment any of us can ever make is in the lives of others.” National Aids Control Council Director Dr Nduku Kilonzo (Left) with Bill Gates, Founder and Chair of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in South Africa during the 2016 International Aids Society conference. The letter generally conveys optimism on the possibility of ending poverty and explains the need to address poverty together with gender inequities, because women with the same opportunities as men will help societies thrive. In the interview following the letter's release, Bill advised men to be involved in reproductive health and help lift the lives of their wives. “Having men involved can have a huge impact. They should join their women to be part of a self help group and share information with each other. As a group they have a voice to give feedback when the health or education system is not providing the right services,” he said. Bill and Melinda Gates have written an annual letter for the past several years.

66,True,True,8.0,REUTERS,23 May 2017 - 15:00,,Kenyan medics say US health aid cuts will mean more abortions,,"President Donald Trump's dramatic expansion of a policy blocking US aid to organisations offering abortion services will have one sure result: more abortions. This is according to medical workers in Kisumu. The United States reinstated the 'Mexico City Policy' in January, cutting some $600 million in funds for family planning programmes overseas. Last week, its scope suddenly mushroomed. Trump expanded it to affect $8.8 billion worth of global health funding, including programmes on HIV/AIDS, malaria and child health. The extension requires all health organisations receiving US aid to guarantee they do not provide abortion services or discuss abortion policy, even if the abortion-related activities are funded by non-US government sources. The policy means cuts to programmes like the one run by Kenyan nurse Monica Oguttu, who founded the Kisumu Medical and Education Trust to help poor women get health care and education in the country's third largest-city. The trust had been scheduled to receive a total of $2 million from USAID from 2017 to 2021, around 56 per cent of its budget. It now expects to lose all its US funding. Oguttu founded the organisation after discovering that half of the women in her gynaecological ward in a Nairobi teaching hospital were there because of the damage done by backstreet abortions. ""One in five of them went home in a coffin,"" she said. ""There was a 17-year-old girl who had lost her uterus and had damage to her rectum. She went home with a colostomy bag ... We would like to save these women."" The Mexico City Policy, started in 1984, has in the past been routinely rescinded under Democratic administrations and reinstated under Republican ones. Oguttu said she remembered when President George Bush reinstated the policy in 2001. Aid groups had to shut eight clinics in Kenya and hike prices in others, according to a study by the Washington D.C.-based Population Action International. ""Suddenly there were no contraceptive methods,"" she said. ""We had so many more complications having to do with post-abortion care from unsafe abortions ... We saw it happen last time and we dread it coming again."" Cuts will force Oguttu's trust to start charging for contraceptives which are currently free, she said. The Kenyan health ministry, recently rocked by strikes in public hospitals and a major corruption scandal, did not return calls seeking comment. AFRICA-WIDE STUDY A 2011 Stanford University study looked at the effects of the Mexico City Policy on 261,116 women in 20 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. It found a dramatic jump in abortion rates during 2001-2008, when the policy was in place, compared to 1994-2001, when it was rescinded. Abortions went up, on average, from 10.4 per 10,000 women to 14.5 per 10,000. In poor countries most dependent on US money for reproductive health services, abortions more than doubled. Joyce, 24, had an abortion at the Kisumu clinic last year so she could continue her university studies. Afterwards, it gave her an IUD contraceptive. ""My life would have been miserable. It would have forced me to drop out of school,"" she whispered. Sitting next to her at the clinic, bright-eyed Margaret Apiyo, 27, said she did not use its abortion services but came for check-ups and to give birth. Despite complications, she has had two healthy daughters. ""They took good care of me, together with the baby I was carrying,"" she said happily. ""Finally I was safe.""

Led by Dutch development minister Lilianne Ploumen, it has since raised $181 million. ""The impact on millions of women and men will be huge,"" she said in a statement on the US policy. ""The number of abortions will not fall, as the US wants, but will in fact rise."" Chimaraoke Izugbara, at the Nairobi-based Africa Population Health Research Centre, said that even if other donors replaced US funding, the money would come at the expense of other health needs.

In 2016, 18 per cent of girl students in both levels became mothers. Of these, about 24,000 aged 10-14 years gave birth. Over 242,000 aged 15-18 years had babies after being impregnated by their fellow students and boda boda operators. The shocking statistics were released yesterday by Ministry of Health programme manager Jean Patrick during the ongoing 42nd Kenya Secondary School Heads’ Association conference in Mombasa. She spoke on the National Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health Policy (2015). Some of the 266,000 girls who gave birth died in the process or later on. Patrick said such students engaged in unsafe abortion because they were not ready to be mothers. “This group are higher at risk of contracting HIV-Aids and STIs. They are also at risk of harmful practices such as FGM and sexual violence,” she said. Narok county had the highest rate of student teenage pregnancies at 40 per cent, followed by Homa Bay (33 per cent) and West Pokot county (29 per cent). This was higher than the national pregnancy rate of 18 per cent. The majority of student mothers from the three counties dropped out of school. Murang’a ( six per cent), Nyeri (seven per cent) and Nyandarua (10 per cent) had low rates of student-mother pregnancy.

Suspended chairman Mohamed Sheria, his deputy Gunda Kaneno and treasurer Joseph Makero are leading the process. A special conference called on Saturday aborted after violence broke out between two opposing factions. This is the second time an important union meeting failed to take place. Sheria said the union's constitution stipulates that should the AGM and the special conference fail to take place, any four members can issue a 14-day notice for another special conference to be called to disband the board. “Thereafter, we will have a 21-day notice issued for another election of 18 board members,” he said at Mbaraki Social Hall. Sheria and his supporters accused DWU general secretary Simon Sang of deliberately disrupting the meeting for fear of being ousted. However, Sang, who had to be whisked away under tight security on Saturday following the violence, said the meeting had to be called off as there was no quorum. The union’s constitution says a quorum should have at least 980 members present within two hours from the start of the meeting. Sang said there were less than 900 members by 4pm. The meeting was scheduled to start at 2pm. “The meeting could not take place. So we will have another meeting within two weeks,” Sang said.

The rapid visual pregnancy test will help reduce infection and abortion or miscarriage in cows which are common with the manual method currently used by vets. Dr Ahmed Kalebi, a pathologist and CEO of Lancet Group of Labs, said it takes only 21 minutes to detect pregnancy. The new technology uses a simple blood test to detect pregnancy in cows as early as 28 days after insemination. The manual method, where a veterinary inserts the hand and forearm through the rectum to feel the womb, can only be done after 40 to 45 days. Kalebi said the rapid test kit will cost Sh1,000 while the conventional method costs a farmer Sh1,400 due to a follow-up that is done two weeks after insemination. ""This rapid test allows the farmers to decide in good time whether to re-inseminate non-pregnant cows or check for possible health problems preventing pregnancy or sell them to save costs of maintaining the unproductive animals,"" said Kalebi in a statement. He said with the conventional methods, farmers wait for at least two weeks before a rectal examination by an expert would identify a non-pregnant cow. ""This means that they would lose at least Sh7,500 on feed, labour and other related costs of owning an unproductive cow over the 15-20 days of uncertainty waiting. It will also help in reducing financial waste, optimising milk production when combined with other management best practices, and to ensure continuity of the productive stock,"" Kalebi said. Lancet's head of veterinary services Dr Dhaval Shah said the new test is meant to complement the conventional methods. ""While the test identifes pregnant animals early after insemination, the same blood sample collected from the tail of the cow can also be used to test for possible diseases that may prevent or impair livestock pregnancy. As a result, the general herd health is improved,"" he said. Shah said milk rapid test will be introduced early next year to make it more convenient to sample animals during milking instead of individually isolating them for blood sampling.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017-10-11-rapid-pregnancy-kit-for-cows-launched-to-curb-infection-miscarriage/
71,True,True,0.0,THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION,17 October 2017 - 12:00,,"Give world's poorest women control over sex, birth to cut inequality - UN",,"A failure to give the world's poorest women control over their bodies could widen inequality in developing countries and thwart progress towards global goals aimed at ending poverty by 2030, the United Nations Population Fund said on Tuesday. Countless women and girls worldwide are denied a say in decisions about sex and childbirth, and struggle to access health services such as family planning, leaving them at risk of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, a UNFPA report said. Access to birth control allows women to delay and space births, reducing mother and child deaths, boosts economies by freeing up women to work, and leads to smaller families with parents able to spend more on children's health and education. Yet many of the world's poorest women - particularly the youngest, least educated and those living in rural areas - are missing out because such services are too few, too costly, or frowned upon by their families and communities, experts say. This can widen the gender gap, reinforce inequality between the poorest and richest, and ultimately weaken economies, UNFPA said in its annual flagship 'State of World Population' report. Denying women access to reproductive health services may also undermine the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global plan to end poverty and inequality by 2030, it said. ""Inequality today is not only about the haves and have nots ... (it) is increasingly about the cans and cannots,"" UNFPA's executive director, Natalia Kanem, said in a statement. ""Poor women who lack the means to make their own decisions about family size or who are in poor health because of inadequate reproductive health care dominate the ranks of the cannots,"" she said ahead of the launch of the report in London. FUNDING THREAT The report comes at an uncertain time for global efforts to improve family planning, with the United States, one of UNFPA's top donors, having said in April it would stop funding the agency. The United States contributed $69 million in 2016. In one of his first actions as US president, Donald Trump reinstated a policy known by critics as the ""global gag"" rule, which withholds US funding for international groups that perform abortions or tell women about legal options to do so. International donors vowed to help the fill the funding gap at a summit on family planning in July, pledging $207 million. Yet UNFPA says it still needs an extra $700 million by 2020. At least 214 million women in developing nations cannot get access to contraceptives - resulting in 89 million unintended pregnancies and 48 million abortions each year, says UNFPA. However, a rising number of countries have pledged to boost their spending on reproductive health services, as part of the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative - which aims to give 120 million more women worldwide access to birth control. Cambodia, Senegal and Rwanda have made the biggest strides since 2005 in reducing inequalities in access to contraception, antenatal care and skilled birth attendants, and cutting neonatal deaths among the poorest mothers, the report found. Universal access to reproductive health services would lead to economic benefits of $430 billion a year, experts say. Every $1 invested in family planning services yields up to $6 in savings on public services from health to housing, studies show. ""When people talk about inequality, they often think about money and wealth ... but economic inequality is just the tip of the equality iceberg,"" Richard Kollodge, senior editor of the UNFPA report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. ""A new perspective which focuses on sexual and reproductive rights can help level the playing field,"" Kollodge added.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017-10-17-give-worlds-poorest-women-control-over-sex-birth-to-cut-inequality-un/
72,True,True,1.0,Thomson Reuters Foundation,17 October 2017 - 15:00,,Senegal's youth tackle sex taboos to boost contraceptive use,,"Watching as dozens of children don robes and belts for a karate class at a youth centre in western Senegal, Aissatou and her peers are gearing up for a different kind of fight. Armed only with leaflets, posters and advice, these young volunteers are taking on a deeply entrenched taboo in the mainly Muslim nation: the use of contraception among girls and women. ""Girls are scared of seeing relatives at a health centre, or being judged by staff,"" said Aissatou, one of 50 volunteers in the Louga region who advise young people about family planning and encourage them to seek health services at the youth centre. ""We offer a safe space to discuss sex, contraception and pregnancy,"" the 22-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. West and Central Africa has one of the world's lowest rates of contraceptive use among women and teenage girls, who often lack knowledge about their options, struggle to access health centres, and face objections from their husbands and families. However in Senegal, a drive to raise awareness, increase stocks of contraceptives, and provide youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services has led to a rapid rise in the number of women and girls on birth control, health experts say. ""In recent years, the family planning community has pointed to Senegal as a beacon of hope for a region that has lagged behind on virtually all health indicators,"" said Perri Sutton, senior programme officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. TARGETING TEENS In Senegal, about one in four married women and girls aged 15 to 49 use modern contraception - up from 12 per cent in 2011 - according to the country's latest national health survey. The Senegalese government aims to lift that figure to 45 per cent by 2020, and increase the number of youth who use sexual and reproductive health services to 70 per cent from 10 per cent. But only 7 per cent of married teen girls use birth control in a country where one in three are wed before 18 - leaving many likely to fall pregnant, and at risk of dying during childbirth. Complications during pregnancy and childbirth - such as fistula - are the leading cause of death among teenage girls worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Reducing teenage pregnancies not only saves lives, but can also improve gender equality in education and in the workforce, thus boosting economies in developing countries, according to an annual flagship report by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). Investing in family planning and narrowing inequality is therefore crucial if the world is to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - a global plan to end poverty, hunger, advance equality, and protect the planet by 2030 - UNFPA said. ""In Senegal, we are honing in on teenage girls ... this is the first generation to have access to information and these services,"" said Andrea Wojnar-Diagne, head of UNFPA in Senegal. ""The real impact will be seen in 20 or even 40 years ... but more still needs to be done to change attitudes in rural areas."" Related: CONTROL About one in three married girls and women in Senegal's cities use birth control, compared with less than a fifth in rural areas - where men are often in charge of such decisions and many people consider family planning to be 'un-Islamic'. In Louga, 180 km (110 miles) from the capital Dakar, Aissatou and her fellow volunteers visit homes, talk on radio shows, and work with imams to challenge stigma surrounding contraceptives. ""We make it clear that we don't encourage sex, or just give out condoms ... and that family planning is not about stopping births, but spacing them, and preserving health,"" she said. In the nearby town of Dahra, midwife Fatim Fall said more girls and women were coming to discuss family planning with the blessing of their husbands. Yet many others, particularly teens, tended to visit at odd hours, without anyone knowing, she added. One night, a woman came with her 14-year-old daughter. The girl had been forced into a marriage her mother had opposed. ""The mother was powerless to stop the wedding,"" Fall said. ""But she realised she could preserve her daughter's childhood and protect her by secretly bringing her to get contraceptives."" Among those waiting to see the midwife, 30-year-old Aminata said she started taking the pill after her first marriage ended in divorce, and discreetly continued to do so after remarrying. ""I feared the marriage wouldn't last, and it didn't,"" she said, smiling wryly. ""I feel at ease about using birth control, my family and friends know I do so and they don't say anything ... people are much more open to it than before."" FUNDING FEARS From pills to implants and injections, modern contraceptives are increasingly available for Senegal ese women in the health system, even in rural regions, and tend to cost less than 500 CFA francs ($1), mainly due to funds from international donors. Yet the United States, one of UNFPA's top donors, said in April it would stop funding the agency as it supports ""coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" - a charge UNFPA denies. It follows the reinstation by US President Donald Trump in January of a policy known by critics as the ""global gag rule"" which withholds US funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. While other nations have vowed to help fill the funding gap, the decision puts pressure on developing countries such as Senegal to invest more in family planning, health activists say. Senegal says it will almost double spending on provision of contraception to 500 million francs ($900,000) by 2020 as part of the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative - which aims to give 120 million more women worldwide access to birth control. In the meantime, volunteers like Aissatou and midwives such as Fall are determined to get more women and girls in Senegal talking about sex, contraception, and family planning - and taking control of all decisions concerning their bodies. ""Sometimes I hear about teenage girls - some as young as 13 - and their newborns both dying,"" Aissatou said. ""It is so sad ... such a waste of life,"" she added. ""It makes no sense.""

After a regular review of Pyongyang's record, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women voiced concern at rape or mistreatment of women in detention especially those repatriated after fleeing abroad. North Korean women are ""under-represented or disadvantaged"" in tertiary education, the judiciary, security and police forces and leadership and managerial positions ""in all non-traditional areas of work"", the panel of experts said. Domestic violence is prevalent and there is ""very limited awareness"" about the issue and a lack of legal services, psycho-social support and shelters available to victims, it said. North Korea told the panel on November 8 that it was working to uphold women's rights and gender equality but that sanctions imposed by major powers over its nuclear and missile programmes were taking a toll on vulnerable mothers and children. The panel said economic sanctions had a disproportionate impact on women. North Korean women suffer ""high levels of malnutrition"", with 28 per cent of pregnant or lactating women affected, it said. The report also found that penalties for rape in North Korea are not commensurate with the severity of the crime, which often goes unpunished. Legal changes in 2012 lowered the penalties for some forms of rape, including the rape of children, rape by a work supervisor and repeated rape. The revised legal code had led to ""reducing the punishment for forcing a woman in a subordinate position to have sexual intercourse from four years to three years"", the report said. Women trafficked abroad and then returned to North Korea, ""are reportedly sent to labour training camps or prisons, accused of ‘illegal border crossing’, and may be exposed to further violations of their human rights, including sexual violence by security officials and forced abortions,"" it said.

At 16 years, she was already married with two children. By her 18th birthday, Fauzia was already separated from her husband and needed to provide for her children. Read: Also read: Born in Majengo, Nairobi, Fauzia was forced to drop out of school after class eight as her parents were not able to cater for any further education for her and her nine siblings. She opted to wash clothes and do other household chores to earn a living. After separating from her husband, it was harder to make ends meet and it is here that her maternal cousin from Lamu convinced her to join al Shabaab where she would make money as an informant - the role generally prescribed for women militants. The promise of employment and source of income to maintain her and her children threw all reason out and Fauzia agreed to join her cousin in Lamu, leaving her sons under the care of her mother. Her cousin, who she referred to as just 'Dogo', took her to Boni Forest, a known al Shabaab hideout before she travelled by sea to Somalia. At the camp, Fauzia's duties were far from what Dogo had told her they would be. In a glum tone, she describes her despondent life at the camp, that of daily abuse and mental torture, ""I was basically a prisoner, repeatedly sexually abused by up to six men at a time. Often we [all the women] were forced to use drugs by al Shabaab, especially Bugizi. (Bugizi is a combination of heroin, marijuana and Rohypnol widely used by al Shabaab, in combination with miraa). She added: ""If you were lucky, a commander would take you as a wife and that would stop other militants from raping you."" She noted it was obvious that only native Somalis became wives. One of the items security agents found when they raided an al Shabaab hideout inside Boni Forest in Lamu, September 18, 2017. /COURTESY 'Alcohol and drugs all night' The women in the camp had to cook, wash clothes for the militants and undertake other household duties. Meanwhile, the fighters frequently physically and sexually abused them. She recalls with tears how some militants would beat her if they did not like something she cooked. Unfortunately, this happened often for Fauzia as she was not familiar with cooking the injera that the militants liked to have The sexual and physical violence was worse when the militants returned from engaging with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). ""They would drink and take drugs all day and night, whether to celebrate killing Somalia National Army and AMISOM soldiers or mourn their own, and that’s when the gang rapes would take place."" Fauzia cannot count the number of times she was raped and forced to take contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Rarely did the rapist militants use condoms. Other girls in the camp conceived but were usually given medication that would induce abortion. The girls that were 'married' to the commanders were allowed to carry their pregnancies. Fauzia remembers that there were 15 children in the camp. Her escape was facilitated by an older man who helped her on a day the captors went on a mission. She says three friends she made at the camp were scared despite the fact that such missions took at least five days. After days of hiding in the bushes, she secured a series of lifts on boats bound for Kenya. On arrival, she found herself in the hands of Kenya Security Forces who, after interrogations and medical check-ups, finally reunited her with her family. Related: Also read: One of the items security agents found when they raided an al Shabaab hideout inside Boni Forest in Lamu, September 18, 2017. /COURTESY Free but HIV+ and stigmatised It has been a year since Fauzia's return. Sadly, she was found to be HIV positive during a medical examination. She is currently on anti-retroviral drugs and is also being treated for tuberculosis. Her poor health limits her ability to work. When she can, she continues to washing clothes. Since her return, her financial situation, a key driver behind her recruitment by al Shabaab in the first place, remains as vague as ever. Fauzia has been ostracised and stigmatised by her community. According to a government official in Nairobi, communities often shun the wives, widows or children of men suspected to have been involved in terror activities. The same goes for women recruited by al Shabaab. The stigma Fauzia faces is made worse by the sexual abuse she endured. Muslim women who have had sex with men other than their husbands - even if these relations are forced - are often shamed by their communities. The psychological trauma Fauzia endured during her time with al Shabaab has been compounded further by the banishment she has faced since her return. Comprehensive counselling programmes are facilitated by the government for her and many other young women returnees Fauzia is among other young girls and women who have been able to find their way back to Kenya after being captives in al Shabaab camps inside Somalia and Libya. In August, three Kenyan girls - Firthoza AAhmed, Aisha Ashur and Tawfiqa Dahir - escaped from their captors in Libya and made their way to Cairo in Egypt, where they sort help from the Kenyan embassy to be brought back home. Fauzia’s account of events resonates with that of other female returnees interviewed earlier. They all speak of sexual abuse by the militants and widespread abuse of drugs in the camps, drugs which female captives are forced to take. According to a Kenyan Anti-Terror Police Unit investigator, sexual violence against women is becoming common in al Shabaab camps.

The issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the Trump administration's objections. In that instance, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on October 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration’s opposition. The two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, requested abortions, but the US Office of Refugee Resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure. In her ruling, Chutkan wrote that the girls' ""constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term"" needed to be preserved. She also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court. “We are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel HHS to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,"" a spokesman for the US Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. ""A pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor. HHS-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.”",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017-12-19-trump-administration-ordered-to-give-immigrant-teens-abortion-access/

The state department said the UNFPA ""supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation"". This is the first of the promised cuts to US financial contributions to the UN by the Trump administration. The UNFPA said it ""regrets the decision"" and has not broken any laws. In total $32.5m (£26m) in funds is being withdrawn for the 2017 financial year. 'Erroneous' claims Earlier this year, President Trump reinstated a ban on US funding of any international organisation that provided any kind of abortion service or advice. The Department of State referred to the presidential directive from January and a provision called the ""Kemp-Kasten Amendment"" in its statement on Monday. ""This determination was made based on the fact that China's family planning policies still involve the use of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation, and UNFPA partners on family planning activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for these coercive policies,"" the state department said. The UNFPA calls those claims ""erroneous"" and that all of its work promotes the rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination. With the support of the US, last year UNFPA says it was able to save the lives of thousands of women from dying during pregnancy and childbirth, prevent unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortions. The BBC's Nada Tawfik in New York reports that the UN Population Fund has often been the target of conservative Republican administrations. President Ronald Reagan, as well as both of the Bush administrations withheld funding for the same reason. The money that had been allocated to the UNFPA for the fiscal year 2017 will be ""transferred and reprogrammed to the Global Health Programs account,"" the state department said.

The two had organized the security meeting and were addressing it when the villagers stormed. They accused the two of ‘looking the other way’ while their land is subdivided and sold to private developers in the pretext of development.

Choga Empeku, a villager, said the original size of the land was about 40 acres but has since been reduced to slightly over 20 acres. Beja Nguta , a representative of the villagers, said they had been doing some farming on their land until early last year when they were told not to step into their farms. “They keep on telling us there are development projects that are supposed to be started here.

87,True,True,3.0,Daily Mail @MailOnline,18 April 2018 - 12:00,,Abortion pill is being used to treat rare hormonal disease,,"A drug company is making millions by hiking up the price of an abortion pill when they sell it to treat a rare hormonal disorder. Mifepristone can cause spontaneous miscarriages, but scientists recently discovered that the compound also treats Cushing's syndrome. The pool of women who could become unintentionally pregnant and need a drug like the abortion pill is potentially as large as the population of women between 15 and 45. Cushing's syndrome, on the other hand, affects only about 10 to 15 million people annually in the world. Drug companies can shorten the research process and reduce its costs if they can find a novel use for an old product - such as treating a rare disorder for which patients have few cheaper alternatives. Mifepristone is sold for aborting pregnancies for around $80, but if you need it to treat a pituitary condition, you will have to shell out more than $500 for a slightly higher dose of the same pill, relabeled Korlym. In combination with misoprostol, mifepristone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2000 to terminate early pregnancies, under the name Mifiprex. Mifepristone blocks the reproductive hormone progesterone, which fuels the thickening of the uterine lining, allowing a fertilized egg to attach and grow in the uterus. This causes the pregnancy to spontaneously end. Related: Read: But mifepristone also blocks the effects of cortisol, the stress hormone produced during metabolism and as a response to stress. Cushing's syndrome is also called hypcortisolism because it occurs when the body is exposed to too much of the hormone, which can cause obesity, fragile skin and muscle weakness and fatigue, high blood cholesterol and sugar and excess hair growth. It can often also cause anxiety and depression and, for men, low sex drive. Cushing's is typically caused by tumors along the pituitary gland, which regulates the release of cortisol. In other cases, it develops as a side effect of taking steroid medications. In most cases, surgical removal of the tumors is the best treatment, but some are not eligible for surgery. For these patients, mifepristone is an optimal alternative - if they can afford the drug. The irony of the up-charge for the abortion pill when it is repackaged as Korlym is that the drug came to market via a pathway intended to make potential treatments for rare diseases more quickly and affordably accessible. Instead of going through a whole new research, development and regulatory approval process, the FDA designated mifepristone an orphan drug in 2012. The orphan drug program incentivizes companies to find treatments for conditions that affect less than 200,000 people. These can include new uses for already existing compounds that were not brought to market. The FDA gives these orphan drugs 12 years of market exclusivity, meaning that no competing drugs can be sold. During this period, there is not competition to stop Korlym's manufacturer, Corcept, from jacking its price up and up - which it has gradually done. Since it was approved, Korlym's price has jumped from $223 per pill to a whopping $550 each, before discounts, according to Still, that is probably far less than the company would have charged for it if it had had to recuperate the costs for the drug's development from scratch, but that does not make the stark difference between two nearly identical drugs any less striking. Sales of Korlym have driven Corcept's net worth up to $190.97 million, as of the end of last year.

She was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. Barbara, who was First Lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. He said in a statement: ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions."" George said his mother had ""kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end"", adding: ""I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes."" A statement from the office of her husband described her as a ""relentless proponent of family literacy"". Barbara was also the mother of Jeb Bush, who served as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2016. As First Lady, she went beyond the traditional role of a political spouse, founding the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to help parents and children from disadvantaged communities to read and write. 'FAMILY ROCK' She was a fierce advocate of civil rights and went against many of her husband's Republican party supporters with her more liberal view on abortion rights. In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said Barbara would be long remembered for her devotion to country and family, ""both of which she served unfailingly well"". Barack and Michelle Obama described her as ""the rock of a family dedicated to public service"" and as ""an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit"". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said Barbara was ""feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes"". He said he and Hillary Clinton would ""never forget the courtesy she and President Bush showed us"". Barbara was known for her snow-white hair and was dubbed ""The Silver Fox"" by her family. She once dismissed speculation that she had influenced her husband during his time in the White House, saying: ""I don't fool around with his office and he doesn't fool around with my household."" George HW Bush, who served as the 41st US president, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair. The couple celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January. It was recently announced that Barbara had declined further medical treatment after a series of hospital visits, but the statement did not reveal the nature of her ailments. She said she wanted to spend her last days in ""comfort care"" with her family. Barbara was one of only two women whose husband and son became US president, and the only one to have seen them both sworn in. Abigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, although she did not live to see their son elected.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-04-18-former-us-first-lady-barbara-bush-dies-at-92/

The case could see safer abortions for thousands of women in the nation. The girl - known by her initials JMM to protect her identity - was raped in 2014 at the age of 15. On discovering she was pregnant, she had a backstreet abortion that left her with injuries which eventually led to her death last month. More on this: Read: JMM's mother, together with the Federation of Women Lawyers, filed a petition in 2015 claiming authorities failed to provide her daughter with proper post-abortion care, and called on the government to implement measures for access to safe abortions. After a three-day hearing, which saw testimonies from ministry of health officials, Christian groups and women's rights organisations, the case has been adjourned until September 18 with a verdict expected by the end of the year. ""My daughter's horrific suffering and tragic death was entirely preventable. I watched her go through more pain than you can imagine, she did not have to die like this,"" JMM's mother said in a statement. ""If our country had any respect for her life and her rights, she would be here today. But how many more girls and women are going to suffer before something is done? Before they receive justice? Kenya has to make abortion safe and accessible."" The 2010 constitution broadened access to abortion, permitting it in cases when a woman's life is at risk and in cases of an emergency. But campaigners say authorities - influenced by powerful Christian organisations - have instead made it harder for women to get safer access to abortions. Since 2010, the Ministry of Health has withdrawn essential guidelines on conducting safe abortions and banned health workers from training on abortion. The guidelines, amongst other things, provided clarity on who could perform abortions, safe-guarding against illegal practitioners. The ban on training has meant fewer health professionals available to perform the procedure or after care. Evelyne Opondo, Africa director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the petitioners in the court case, said JMM's post-abortion care was a direct consequence of Kenya's crackdown on safe abortion services. Following her abortion, JMM developed an infection and was transferred between four hospitals as staff did not know how to treat her. She suffered kidney failure and was bedridden for months before her death on June 10. ""While JMM was entitled to quality post abortion care irrespective of whether it was within the law or otherwise, she did not receive it from the point of first contact with the health system,"" said Opondo. ""Instead there were several delays and missed opportunities to mitigate the adverse effect of the unsafe abortion on her health and life."" The petitioners are seeking compensation from the government for JMM's family, as well as the reinstatement of the abortion guidelines and the scrapping of the ban on training.

Internal memos from City Hall’s legal department seen by the Star indicate county government lawyers under Kidero’s administration held that Francis Mburu owns the land and should be compensated. One of the memos from Erick Odhiambo, City Hall’s legal affairs assistant director, states the county illegally allocated several plots to individuals who developed the multibillion-shilling property. The memo is addressed to Odhiambo’s boss, the legal affairs director. Read: The lawyer suggested that City Hall compensates Mburu’s firms — Afrison Export Import Ltd and Huelands Ltd — which are registered as the owners of the 58.6 acres of land. Other than Drive In Primary School and Ruaraka High School which occupy 13 acres of the disputed land, Odhiambo said in the memo there are several buildings whose legal status cannot be confirmed. He added that Barclays Bank and Rafiki Enterprises have developments on the larger 58.6 acres. “From the records available, there was a subdivision carried out in 1985 on the said parcel but was never finalised; thus the individual registration of the resultant subplots was never carried out. This would appear to be the reason why we still have the LR No.7879/4 still in the records.” “.. City Council of Nairobi did not have any business allocating the said land to individuals... It has been in local dailies that the government has compensated the said owner to the extent of the parcel in occupation by the GSU. Imperatively, it will be best for the county to do equally the same,” Odhiambo says in the memo. Details: This appears to be the same position taken by Interior CS Fred Matiangi’s ex-legal advisor Martin Oloo, insisting land records clearly indicate the parcel is private. “The registrar of titles confirms that Ruaraka land L.R No. 7879/4 measuring 96 acres is private freehold land in the name of Afrison Import Export and Huelands Ltd as joint owners,” Oloo said, noting the position has been affirmed in three different court cases. Oloo accused the Senate of ignoring a court order which ruled the land belonged to the claimant and should be paid Sh4 billion as compensation. This follows a Senate report that wants Matiang’i and PS Belio Kipsang held responsible for approving Sh1.5 billion payments for the land. “Who carries more weight in establishing land ownership; a Ministerial Quality Assurance Committee or a constitutional body that is the National Land Commission?” he said. Mburu said he reached an out-of-court deal with City Hall, which had agreed to pay him Sh23 billion for the land. The deal, he claims, was to see City Hall pay him over five years which would mean annual installments of Sh4.6 billion. Government paid Mburu Sh2.4 billion between 2012 and 2017 following a court battle. The amount was negotiated down from the court-ordered Sh4.2 billion. But the payment was for the 37.4 acres occupied by the GSU. The memo has contradicted Governor Mike Sonko’s insistence that City Hall’s records indicate that the land is public. Sonko and his officers — Lands executive Charles Kerich and Urban Planning chief officer Julius Kathenge — told Parliament last month that City Hall’s records show Mburu does not own the land. The internal correspondence has further deepened the mystery, as Parliament probes whether Mburu owns the land, or was paid by government several times for the same property. In 2011, another internal memo from City Hall’s chief valuer identified as KJ Ayiecho to the assistant legal director also states Mburu owns the land, after purchasing it from Joreth Ltd. In the same year, the land was the subject of Parliament proceedings, when Cherangany MP Joshua Kuttuny questioned why government used public funds to pay land rates for private property. But former Internal Security assistant minister Orwa Ojode said the Sh20 million payment was made to stop City Hall from auctioning the land to recover due rates which Mburu was unable to pay. Ojode added that government was then unable to compulsorily acquire the land because there were ongoing court battles over it. The former assistant minister, who died a year later, held that government intended to acquire an additional 20 acres to put up housing for police officers. Mburu says he bought 96 acres in 1981, and was to put up housing units for Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation staff. But the deal aborted after Continental Credit Finance, which had given Mburu a loan to carry out the project, went under. KPTC also dropped its interest in the project following financial troubles. The DCI and EACC could arraign up to 25 people over the Ruaraka land, arguing the payment Mburu received was a scheme by officials in City Hall, NLC, and Lands and Education ministries to swindle money.

The aborted strike was organised by Kenya Motorists Association to protest the proposed 16 per cent Value Added Tax on petroleum products from September 1. The association's chairman Peter Murima had asked motorists sympathetic to their course to dump their vehicles on the road between 7.30am and 9.30am. A spot check by the Star indicated that the strike did not happen as planned. But speaking to the Star on phone, Murima said the strike took place adding that it will take place every Wednesday for two hours. ""The strike started as planned and has taken off very well. In fact, it started at Roysambu estate where all the actions were carried out,"" he said. Murima said some motorists who were in solidarity with the members kept off the roads and that is why there was no traffic around Nairobi. ""We will do this every Wednesday until the government can change this dynamic. We will even go to court if they don't want to change this,"" he said. Earlier, Matatu owners association chairman Simon Kimutai told Citizen TV that the responsibility of PSV's is to carry passengers, not to go on a go slow. Kimutai said the planned strike flopped for lack of consultation from stakeholders. ""What is important is to sit and discuss with those who have done it before. Asking people to leave or park their vehicles on the road whilst inconveniencing other motorists is not the solution,"" he said. The MOA chairman said the fuel hikes will affect every consumer and not only the public service sector. If implemented, the new prices will see an increase of about Sh15 to Sh17 per litre of fuel. Read: ""I sympathize with the situation. It's not our liking ... we cannot absorb this cost. We will not be in the business. We can make 70 per cent losses if that happens,"" Kimutai said. Kimutai noted that they will be fair to the consumers adding that the fares will only be added by about Sh10. ""W e will calculate and absorb the impact caused by the fuel. If you were paying Sh30 bob It will go up by Sh10 bob. The long days of matatus misbehaving are history,"" he said. When asked if matatu owners can think of other ways to bear the cost, Kimutai said its not an easy thing to do. "" However creative you could be, at the end of the day cash is involved- we do not get any subsidies from any position,"" he said. "" It would have been great for the government to explore other avenues that can increase revenue to the government or collection of taxes."" Kimutai said people have the misconception that there is a lot of money in the matatu industry adding that ""It is a very expensive venture to get into,"" ""It is very risky and has minimal profits... We have had fare hikes for a long time and we do it in a good way,"" he said. SECURITY Police had been mobilized and ordered to disperse any motorist who tries to block roads in the planned protest by motorists over proposed fuel tax. Police warned that they will not allow such a protest and urged those planning to do so to desist from the move.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-08-22-hyped-motorists-strike-flops-as-traffic-flows-freely-in-nairobi/
98,True,True,0.0,DAILY MAIL,26 August 2018 - 12:00,,'My pain and shame': Pope apologises for Catholic church sex abuse,,"Pope Francis has met victims of abuse and mistreatment in Ireland, telling them that those who abuse children were the equivalent of human excrement. He spent 90 minutes speaking with eight Irish survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse during the first papal visit to Ireland since 1979. The Pontiff told of the two abuse survivors that 'those involved in corruption and cover up within the church are 'caca"", with his translator clarifying: 'Literally filth as one sees in the toilet'. Pope Francis spoke with the group before attending a Festival of Families celebration yesterday at Croke Park Stadium in Dublin, where he received a standing ovation after telling the 82,500-strong crowd that 'to hate is human, to forgive is divine'. He was greeted by enthusiastic nuns hoisting papal flags and performing Mexican waves at the event, where he stressed the importance of family, and warned people of the 'threat' social media poses to relationships. He said social media should 'never become a threat to the real life relationships by imprisoning us in a virtual reality and isolating us from the very real relationships that challenge us to grow. 'When you use social media too much you go into a sort of an orbit when, at the dinner table, instead of talking to each other within the family, each of you uses his phone to connect with the outside world. 'You go into an orbit. This is dangerous. Why? Because it takes away the completeness of the family and... takes us to a fuzzy life without any substance.' The evening included a performance of Riverdance by 500 children from dance schools around Ireland, and entertainment from local and international artists – joined by an orchestra of more than 50 musicians – including Andrea Bocelli. The two-hour-long festival was choreographed as a celebration of family life, featuring music, song, dance, and spoken word. The pope arrived at Croke Park for the mammoth festival flanked by burly bodyguards, after spending 90 minutes speaking with eight Irish survivors of abuse. The private meeting was hosted at the Papal Nuncio's residence in Dublin, hours after he acknowledged that Irish people had a right to be outraged by the church's response to the crimes. The enthusiastic crowd's standing ovation rounded off the pope's first day in Ireland, which has seen him speak of his 'pain and shame' at the 'grave scandal' of clerical sex abuse amid protests over the Catholic Church scandal – as thousands of admirers crowded the streets of Dublin to wave and watch him go by in his custom-made Popemobile. The pontiff said victims had a right to be outraged at the 'repellent crimes' against young people, while Ireland's prime minister Leo Varadkar urged him to 'listen to the victims', saying the history of abuse had left a legacy of 'sorrow and shame'. The Vatican says Pope Francis has met with eight survivors of clerical and institutional abuse on the first day of his trip to Ireland, which is ground zero for the Catholic Church's abuse scandal. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said Francis met with the group for about 90 minutes this evening. Among the victims was Marie Collins, a prominent survivor who served on Francis' advisory board but quit in frustration last year. She has since become a harsh critic of the Vatican, and occasionally the pope. The 81-year-old landed in Dublin this morning on an Alitalia flight from Rome – flying with the call sign 'Shepherd One' – to begin the first visit by a Pope to Ireland since John Paul II visited in 1979. He greeted a country where Catholic loyalties are declining and which recently distanced itself further from the Vatican's teaching with a referendum vote to legalise abortion, three years after similar backing for same-sex marriage. This afternoon he met Ireland's first gay prime minister. Tens of thousands gathered in Dublin as he passed through in his Popemobile, a Skoda Rapid model, waving and smiling to the crowds on Dame Street. But demonstrators also assembled around the city to protest against clerical crimes, amid a row over the Vatican's response to similar claims of institutional abuse in America. Speaking at St Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle, the Pope said: 'With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,' he said. 'The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community. I myself share those sentiments.' 'It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole,' he said. He also praised his predecessor, Benedict XVI, for tackling the issue, saying: 'His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church's leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.'",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-08-26-my-pain-and-shame-pope-apologises-for-catholic-church-sex-abuse/

The family accused Governor Obado and his personal assistant, Michael Oyamo, of masterminding Sharon’s murder after she refused to abort a pregnancy. But Obado’s communications director Nicholas Anyuor dismissed the claim, saying the family could not prove it. The body of the 26-year old second-year Rongo University student was found at Kodera forest in Kasipul constituency on Tuesday evening. Read: She had been abducted in Rongo town, Migori, on Monday night alongside Nation journalist Barack Oduor who escaped by jumping from the speeding car. Her body was ripped with multiple cuts and could barely be identified. Family members and villagers who had thronged their home on Wednesday morning charged Obado with complicity in the killing. Sharon’s father, Douglas Zacharia Otieno, and mother Melida Auma claimed Migori governor Okoth Obado and his personal assistant, Michael Oyamo, were responsible. Melida, a teacher at Rabango Primary School in Rangwe, narrated the love relationship, which the governor had with her first-born daughter. She said the governor wanted her to abort her pregnancy but they advised her against it since it was in its seventh month. ""She told us about her pregnancy and the person behind it. I told her not to abort because it could result in many complications,"" Melida said. According to Melida, her refusal to abort led to disagreement between Sharon and Obado. Melida said she realised that her daughter’s life was in danger after she began changing mobile phones to avoid being tracked by her friends who had turned enemies. ""I asked her why she frequently changed mobile lines and she told me she was being threatened because she had refused to abort the pregnancy,” she added. Read: But Anyuor defended Obado against the accusations. He said Auma spoke out of anger and was responding to ""pressure from some quarters"". He said the governor was “very shocked when he learnt about this incident in the media.” ""They can’t prove the pregnancy belonged to the governor,"" he said. He said there was no way the county chief could be linked to the murder and dismissed the claims as a political scheme to malign Obado. ""If Oyamo participated in the abduction, why associate it with the governor?"" he asked. But Melida linked Obado and his personal assistant Oyamo because of the conversations they had with her daughter about him. Melida said she had followed conversation between the governor and her daughter over county government tender awards and alluded to several meetings between her daughter, the governor and Oyamo. She recalled a meeting in which Sharon left home early morning about two weeks ago to meet the “governor’s people” in Nairobi. Sharon flew to Nairobi from Kisumu airport and returned home the same day. ""Sharon told me she was boarding a plane to Nairobi and the journey was sponsored by the governor. I later realised that she received money for the trip through Oyamo,"" Melida said. On Monday evening when Sharon was abducted in Rongo town, she called her and told her she was going to Rongo to meet Oyamo briefly and return later. ""She told me the objective of the journey was to discuss how the county government would award her a tender,"" Melida said, adding that she was surprised Sharon had decided to leave home late. ""Sharon had never demonstrated a habit of staying outside home beyond 7pm,"" she said. This prompted her to call again at 8pm only to find her phone was off. ""I was worried,"" Melida said. Sharon’s father, Otieno, said, ""I went to Rachuonyo hospital mortuary and identified my daughter after being called by police. We are calling for justice in this matter.""

Sharon had a seven months pregnancy when she was killed. Migori governor Okoth Obado has denied any involvement, but the investigators plan to take his blood samples as well, as they seek to confirm reports by Sharon’s family that he had a sexual relationship with their daughter. “We are following all leads, including claims that Sharon could have been involved with Obado,” DCI officer Hassan Siyad said in a sworn affidavit. Read: Sharon’s mother Melida Otieno said on Wednesday that her daughter was in a relationship with Obado, She said the governor had sent money to facilitate her abortion. Yesterday, police officers probing the case visited the site where the body was recovered and took statements from family members. Obado’s personal assistant Michael Oyamo is said to have lured Sharon to her death. He will be detained by police until Monday next week. Police in Homa Bay secured a court order allowing them to detain him so he can help them with investigations. Police said the matter was too complex and they could not complete the investigations within 24 hours after his arrest on Tuesday in Uriri, Migori. Oyamo was arrested after being implicated in abduction of Nation journalist Barack Oduor and Sharon in Rongo town on Monday night. Sharon was pursuing a diploma in medical records and information at Rongo University, Migori. She was found dead near Kodera Forest in Homa Bay on Tuesday evening. Yesterday, Oyamo did not take a plea in court. He was accused of murdering or causing the murder of Sharon. “I notify this court of the arrest and due to technicalities involved in the investigations, I pray to the court that he be detained at Homa Bay police station for 14 days to enable us to complete investigations,” Siyad told the court. Read: Homa Bay deputy registrar Lester Simiyu granted their request. However, she gave them until Monday to return him to court. On Monday, Oyamo can either be released or charged. “I believe Oyamo and other suspects involved in the abduction and murder have intentions, which could be a threat to national security and public tranquillity,” Siyad said. At the site where Sharon's body was found, there was blood concentrated at one point. Detectives led by Homa Bay DCI commander Danial Wachira and his colleagues from Nairobi visited the scene in Obisa village, Rachuonyo South. They collected samples. They also interrogated residents to get leads — their visit lasting for five hours. They proceeded to Rachuonyo South Subcounty Hospital mortuary in Oyugis town where Sharon’s body is. They scrutinised the body and had a 10-minute private meeting with staff. Journalists were told to stay away. A postmortem was postponed to today. Wachira said they were waiting for a pathologist to undertake the process. “We’re expecting the government pathologist tomorrow [today] so that a postmortem can be done,” he said.

The homicide team that was dispatched to Migori and Homa Bay has so far recorded statements from seven people, including her parents and friends. They have all implicated Obado. Yesterday, Obado dispatched his lawyer, Cliff Ombeta, to witness the postmortem performed by chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor. The preliminary results released last night showed that Sharon died from excessive bleeding. Read: Oduor also revealed that autopsy results indicated that the second-year medical records student may have been raped before her murder. The government pathologist said the bleeding was caused by a total of eight stab wounds. “She was stabbed three times in the neck, four times in the back and in the left side of the abdomen,” Oduor said. He said the victim’s body also bore signs of strangulation and bruises that suggested she attempted to fight her killers. Oduor spoke at the end of the postmortem examination of Sharon's body at the Rachuonyo Level 4 Hospital in Homa Bay county. Obado was represented by a private pathologist and Ombeta. Sharon’s family was represented by a private pathologist after they requested one. Oduor said the stab wound on Sharon's body went through her abdomen and pierced the unborn baby. She was seven months' pregnant, according to family sources. Oduor said the stab wound went all the way through to her back. “It means that the baby also died from the same injuries that the late Sharon sustained,"" he said. The pathologist said samples have been taken for further analysis to enable medical detectives to unravel the mystery behind the gruesome murder. Read: Sharon was abducted on Monday alongside Nation journalist Barack Oduor from a hotel in Rongo. The journalist however managed to escape by jumping out of the moving vehicle and seeking help. He told reporters that they were lured into the abduction by Governor Obado’s personal assistant Michael Juma Oyamo who is currently in custody. Sharon’s body was discovered two days later on Wednesday near Kodera Forest, Homa Bay county. Obado has not been seen in public since Sharon was abducted on Monday. He was last seen at the Kisumu airport on Monday when he boarded a plane for Nairobi. He was due to represent the Council of Governors at a meeting in Rwanda that ended yesterday, however, he did not travel. His phone has also been off since Thursday. The police in Nairobi, meanwhile, were analysing Sharon's phone to establish the contacts she made through calls and text messages. They are particularly focussing on the conversations between her and Obado in the last three months because those who have recorded statements claim that the two had a falling out a few weeks ago. The police are also doing multi-lateration, which involves looking at phone signals from her phone and the suspects, including Obado's, as they seek to place them together. The police yesterday were also able to gain access to Obado's aide Oyamo's mobile phone and are hoping to find some clues. The investigators also believe that the child Sharon was carrying, and its DNA, could provide a major clue in their search for the killer and the motive. It has been claimed that Obado had an affair with Sharon and according to her mother, Hellen, the Governor had sent her daughter money for abortion.

""The board has banned Marie Stopes from airing a message on the radio that promotes abortion contrary to Article 26 (4) of the Constitution,"" he said.

An estimated 119,912 women received care for complications from unsafe abortions, such as organ or systems failure, shock, and in some instances these complications led to death. The study was published by the Health ministry in 2013. It also found that 48 per cent of those who sought post-abortion care after unsafe abortion were women aged less than 25 years, while 17 per cent were teenagers aged 10-19 years. Abortion is an emotive and extremely divisive issue all over the world, and it is no different in Kenya.

The unmet need for contraceptives amongst the 15 – 19-year-olds stands at 27%. Currently, three out of five adolescents worldwide – or 23 million people – who want to use contraceptives to prevent an unplanned pregnancy are being denied it. Adolescents are often told that sex outside marriage is wrong, while some countries have even created laws to block unmarried adolescents from accessing contraceptives. When they do marry – often while still very young – they face pressure to have children almost immediately. ""Too often, society treats young people as irresponsible or naïve, and withholds the resources they need to prevent or delay unplanned pregnancies,"" Dana Tilson, Country Director at Marie Stopes Kenya, said. ""At Marie Stopes Kenya, we know this situation has to change if we are to see a world in which every girl has the same opportunities as the boys around her."" Blocking access to contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) does not prevent young people from having sex, but instead increases the chance that young women will experience an unplanned pregnancy, often derailing their hopes and dreams for the future. The impact of this is devastating. Complications from pregnancy are the leading cause of death among young women aged 15-19, many due to unsafe abortion. Unplanned pregnancy can also limit the ability of young people to remain in education and realise their full potential, resulting in greater costs to society through lower wages for women and increased population growth. ""When women and girls have access to contraception, it is transformative for their future: Fewer girls drop out of school, fewer young women die giving birth, and more young women enter the workforce.

The main victims are adolescent girls and young women aged 10 – 24 years. The estimates comprise those reported within the healthcare system thus the number could be much higher. An estimated 2,600 women die from unsafe abortions annually In Kenya safe abortion is legal under certain circumstances. Article 26 Subsection 4 of the Constitution of Kenya allows safe abortion where in the opinion of a trained health care professional: there is need for emergency treatment of the mother, or the life of the mother is in danger, or the physical, emotional or psychological health of the mother is in danger or if permitted by any other written law. There is widespread misunderstanding of the constitution and the law, which results in women choosing not to seek safe abortion services when it is their right. This misunderstanding of the law also makes trained providers reluctant to provide safe abortions services even when it is legal, because they are afraid they will be prosecuted. As a result of this misunderstanding of the law, and fear and stigma, most women end up going to untrained providers or use unsafe means to terminate a pregnancy. Seven women and girls die every day due to unsafe abortion. Marie Stopes Kenya is an organization that helps women and girls if they have an unplanned pregnancy crisis.

Here are the 5 most important things you need to know and yes, number 3 will shock you. You know it is an Unsafe Abortion if… The person providing the abortion service is neither a qualified doctor, nurse, midwife nor clinical officer. The person providing the abortion service has NOT been trained and certified as a provider of safe abortions. The abortion service is provided in an environment that does not meet minimal medical standards, including cleanliness, sterile equipment, knowledge in complication management and proper referral systems. Common places these unsafe abortions are conducted include homes (bedrooms); lodgings, or even private offices. Proper counselling and proper medical examination have not been offered with alternative options. Use of unconventional and unsafe methods including sticks, needles, detergents and herbs. Safe abortion is a human right and every woman has a right to access safe abortion services. Article 43 of the Kenyan constitution states that every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to health care services, including reproductive health care.

The rate at which innocent lives are lost in the most painful and brutal manner is worrying and a direct indication that something is really wrong with our society. We have lost touch with reality of life and people have become more corrupt and evil and nothing matters to them including life. What matters is what people can get in terms of money or how they can avenge on their enemies. The fabric of the nation has been affected and broken, we no longer promote values that we used to promote before, vices like killing innocent people and rape have unfortunately become the new norm. Today many people openly ridicule religious leaders and the fear of God is no longer with us. When a society loses its conscious then what follows is corruption, murder like the ones we are currently witnessing and things like abortions because people do not value anything. When morals go down, the society become disorderly and everything and anything is possible. Kenyans don't respect the law. We break the law at will and this begins from our elected leaders to law enforces. Even these fires you see in schools evidence a broken morality because even the younger generations are learning fast from our rot. As the scripture says, we are living in the last days and we must make a bold move to restore what has gone wrong by embracing the old values. To get out of this mess, leaders and those in authority must live by example, they should not preach water and drink wine. The political and religious leaders should guard their actions and utterances, some of which make young people think that doing wrong is right. We celebrate evil in today's society and the time has come for us to start celebrating good. Let us look at those heroes, those people who are doing good and celebrate them. All religious leaders should start preaching values to the young people across the county and act as good models. In social places let us observe good morals and Kenya will become the most beautiful society and this brutal murders will automatically take a decline.

109,True,True,0.0,REUTERS @Reuters,09 October 2018 - 15:00,,Freshly minted Justice Kavanaugh gets to work at US Supreme Court,,"Just three days after he was narrowly confirmed to the US Supreme Court despite facing allegations of sexual assault, Brett Kavanaugh is set to take his seat on the bench on Tuesday morning, solidifying a conservative majority for years to come. Kavanaugh , 53, will join the eight other justices to hear arguments in cases involving a federal criminal sentencing law, bringing the nine-member court back up to full strength after the retirement of Anthony Kennedy in July. Kavanaugh 's confirmation gave Republican President Donald Trump a major victory, with his second lifetime appointee to the nation's highest judicial body. Neil Gorsuch joined the court last year. The bitterly divided US Senate voted 50-48 on Saturday to confirm Kavanaugh, with just one Democrat supporting him. Read: Kavanaugh 's elevation to the high court had been considered safe until California university professor Christine Blasey Ford went public with explosive allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982, while they were in high school. Two other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh denied the allegations and in a blistering partisan attack during a Senate hearing on September 27, accused Democrats of an ""orchestrated political hit."" He wrote later in a newspaper opinion piece that he regretted some of his comments, but critics said it raised questions about whether he would treat all who come before him fairly. Hundreds of law professors and even retired Justice John Paul Stevens, a Republican appointee, said Kavanaugh 's remarks should disqualify him from the job. Other analysts said the court's reputation could suffer as it becomes perceived as a political, rather than a legal, institution. At a White House ceremony on Monday night, Kavanaugh sought to put the confirmation battle behind him, saying he was starting his new job without bitterness. ""Although the Senate confirmation process tested me as it has tested others, it did not change me,"" he said. PUSHING COURT TO RIGHT Kavanaugh moves to the Supreme Court after spending 12 years as a judge on the influential US Court of Appeals in Washington, where he built a conservative judicial record and a reputation for being affable and well-prepared. In the 1990s, before becoming a judge, Kavanaugh was part of special counsel Kenneth Starr's team that investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton. The new justice is widely expected to push the court further to the right as he is replacing Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes voted with the liberal justices on key social issues, including in pivotal cases on gay rights. Kavanaugh can be expected to cast crucial votes on a matters including abortion, gun control, immigration, and voting rights. Kavanaugh 's views on presidential powers could be tested within days in a dispute over whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross should submit to questioning by lawyers suing the Trump administration over a decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. If an appeals court does not stop Ross's deposition, the administration is expected to turn to the high court. Although his reputation was tarnished by the sexual misconduct claims, Kavanaugh said during his confirmation hearings that he had a record of promoting women in the legal profession. All four of the law clerks Kavanaugh has hired this term are women, which is a first for a Supreme Court justice. Kavanaugh has moved into the chambers previously occupied by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who has taken over Kennedy's chambers. The oral arguments on Tuesday concern the 1984 Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a ""three-strikes-and-you're-out"" criminal sentencing law that boosts prison sentences after multiple violent felonies or drug offenses. The cases challenge the types of crimes that qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA and can lead to 15-year mandatory minimum sentences for the defendant. In one case, the justices will review a Florida robbery conviction. The other two cases relate to burglary convictions in Tennessee and Arkansas.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-10-09-freshly-minted-justice-kavanaugh-gets-to-work-at-us-supreme-court/
110,True,True,4.0,by Frank Muchugu,09 October 2018 - 03:00,,What the law says about Abortions,,"Over 120,000 women were hospitalized for complications due to unsafe abortions in one year. While stigma over the procedure and in some cases cost, may be a factor in why women are choosing the more nefarious path, it is becoming more evident that an ignorance of the law is leading to the deaths of seven women a day, Maternal mortality is the country’s leading killer of women – and of that a whopping 35 percent of deaths are caused by unsafe abortions. It is important to remember that the global average is 13 percent. One reason behind this, is while the procedure is legal, under certain circumstances, the penal code is unclear, leading to confusion from law enforcement. Dr. John Nyamu, Director of reproductive services in Nairobi, echoed this, saying that while women may be going for legal and safe abortions, the consequences were unclear. He added, “We need to change the penal code, because it has not been changed since 2010 and it still allows police to arrest anyone from health providers under certain sections of the penal code.” Some of these penal codes include article 158 which states that, “Any person who, with intent to procure miscarriage of a woman, whether she is or is not with child, unlawfully administers to her or causes her to take any poison or other noxious thing, or uses any force of any kind, or uses any other means whatever, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.” Additionally, article 160 also penalizes any person who unlawfully supplies to or procures for any person anything, whatever that would be used to procure the miscarriage of a woman whether she is with child or not. While it could be argued that these are reasonably penal codes, it is easy to see how they can be misconstrued and used to persecute not only women who need to have an abortion but the health professionals themselves. Particularly by law enforcement or officials who are decidedly against the procedure. Charles Ngwena was once quoted saying, “Laws that criminalize abortion but without concomitantly articulating clearly the grounds for lawful abortion…unduly deter healthcare providers from providing health services to women even where abortion is lawful. Equally such laws create misperceptions about abortion as conduct that is criminal are all times.” It is this belief that it is illegal that leads thousands of women to seek help from quacks, leading to health complications, infections, infertility and even death. Abortions are a serious issue facing a number of women in Kenya, and if you find yourself with an unplanned pregnancy, you are not alone.

One group, however, feels the President is too ‘young’ to retire. They are pushing for a referendum to change the Constitution for an inclusive government that accommodates a prime minister. The group, backed by powerful political establishments, wants Uhuru to remain powerful in the government that will be formed after the 2022 polls. ""We only have one defacto leader - Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta - the rest are wannabes,"" nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura told the Star on the phone. RUTO'S ALLY The second group oscillates around Deputy President William Ruto, who is likely to be Uhuru’s successor after the President announced last month in Nandi that he will support Ruto’s presidential bid. Uhuru was touring development projects in the region. ""We were told in Nyeri to focus on development. Agenda one, development, agenda two, development and agenda three, development,"" nominated MP MP Cecily Mbarire said. Read: More: PRO-CHANGE However, the third group wants a change of the status quo. They argue that Uhuru’s support for Ruto was personal. ""During the change of guard (after completion of the term of a sitting president) the incoming President must come from outside to get to power,"" former Kiambu governor William Kabogo said. ""To climb to power from within (VP/DP) happened only once when Mzee Moi succeeded Hayati Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Hustler, think."" Apart from the first team of the political establishment, the two teams want a change of the status quo in the region. The groups fighting to hold the grip on the region want to have a stake in the next government where they can influence policies at the national level. ""Uhuru caught them unawares when he said he is not interested in any other post after he serves his last term. But politics is constant and a contest. People will continue to jostle,” historian Macharia Munene told the Star on the phone. Observers told the Star the status quo has only favoured a few elites within the region. ""The fight is to protect economic and political interests. It is all about interests,"" International Center for Policy and Conflict director Ndung’u Wainana said. The groups against the establishment argue that Uhuru is not accessible and the area lags in development, despite voting for him overwhelmingly in the last polls. ""Our focus now is development and we are determined to see the people have a better life,"" Mwaura said. Despite politicians being the face of the tough succession battle, sources privy to the developments in the regions told the Star the business community, the clergy and professionals are heavily involved. Some are said to be ready to fund in a bid to push for their agenda. Many politicians refused to comment. ""People are trying to create their own independent identity to shift their own negotiations. They are coming up with their own plans and jostling for their interests,"" Wainaina said. ABORTED ENDORSEMENT With the fast shaping political landscape in the region, those who trust in the DP say Ruto is accessible and has helped them grow both economically and politically. On March 29, plans by the group to endorse Ruto in Naivasha aborted after an MP called State House and other power brokers to raise the alarm.

Addressing journalists at KNH, Kenya national union of nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said Wairimu does not appear in their register.

Dr Josephine Kibaru-Mbae, director general of the National Council for Population and Development, said this was achieved by putting 1.7 million more women on modern contraceptives. ""This means we also averted the complications that go with unplanned pregnancies, like unsafe abortions and maternal mortality,"" Kibaru said. In total, 5.6 million Kenyan women of reproductive health age (15-49 years) are currently on modern family planning methods. Kenya’s current population of 50 million people is projected to reach 95 million in 2050 and 142 million in 2100, according to projections released by the United Nations last year. Nairobi –currently with four million residents – is projected will have 14 million people in 2050 and 46 million in 2100, according to the Toronto-based Global Cities Institute. Kibaru said Kenya requires at least Sh2.3 billion to buy family planning products every year. Currently, the government provides Sh1.9 billion while donors bridge the difference. ""For sustainability, Kenya is moving family planning services to the National Hospital Insurance Fund,” she said at the ongoing International Family Planning Conference in Kigali, Rwanda. She challenged county governments to allocate funds to family planning to reduce the burden on central government. The efforts will ensure the population growth does not outpace economic development. Kenya is racing against time to reap a demographic dividend, where people live longer and have smaller families. This frees up investments that would be used to take care of many children, for other economic activities. Kibaru said Kenya is on track because 58 per cent of women now use modern birth control methods and the fertility rate is reducing. ""We’ve steadily increased family planning uptake and in 2016 we surpassed our target and we sat together and worked on a new goal,"" she said yesterday. Kenya has 3.9 births per woman, according to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey of 2014. Siddharth Chatterjee, the UN resident coordinator, said the country must create one million jobs every year to enjoy demographic dividend, or it will end up with many jobless youths who will not drive any growth. One million Kenyan youths join the workforce every year, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. ""Steps should be taken to strengthen youth employment strategy in line with the education system in Kenya, to better deliver relevant skills and competencies by the job market,"" Chatterjee said. Evelyn Samba, Kenya country director at DSW, a global reproductive health group, said the most significant threat to access to family planning is inadequate funds. ""Traditionally, family planning programmes have depended on donor funding, yet donor funds have been dwindling over the years,"" she said. ""County governments also bear the responsibility of investing in the necessary enablers to provide family planning services.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-11-13-kenya-averts-2-million-pregnancies-in-race-against-overpopulation/

They warned that the anti-pregnancy drugs or devices promote immorality and could devastate society. They also maintained their opposition to legalisation of abortion. Through the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, the church says an early pregnancy is a form of child abuse that should be dealt with within the law. “The rights of people don’t include destruction of other forms of life. We urge the government to wipe out commercials advocating freedom of choice,” KCCB chairman Philip Anyolo said in Nairobi. The clerics argue that the use of contraceptives exposes girls to long-term complications that could leave their reproductive health in ruins. “Agreeing to provide contraceptives only means we have given a go-ahead to teenagers to engage in sex, which is against the law,” Anyolo said. Reproductive health doctor Susan Macharia disagreed. She said contraceptives cannot cause lifelong effects if used properly. Macharia encouraged the use of condoms among the teens to prevent pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. “Most hormonal contraceptives have short-term side effects like nausea, vomiting, irregular periods, and tenderness of the breast, among others,” Macharia said. According to a 2017 study published in the US Western Journal of Medicine, oral contraceptives are the most common contraception used by adolescents. It says 44 per cent of sexually active teenagers aged between 15 and 19 use them. Meanwhile, the Catholic clergy defended maize farmers’ demands that the price for a 90kg bag be increased. They said the recently gazetted price of Sh2,300 was too low. Last year, the government paid Sh3,000. The men of the cloth urged the government to intensify the war on corruption and have all culprits brought to book. “We want to applaud government agencies in the crackdown on corrupt individuals and urge them to freeze and recover assets after prosecution of corrupt individuals,”Anyolo said.

The lobby group filed a suit against the CS for Health, the Director of Medical Services, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, the Kenya Film and Classification Board and its CEO Ezekiel Mutua. Co-counsel Sofia Rajab-Leteipan of Leteipan and Associates Advocates filed a case at the High Court challenging the KMPDB and medical regulatory authority on a decision to ban Marie Stopes from providing any abortion and post-abortion care. This is despite the Constitution allowing abortion when the health or the life of the woman is in danger or in emergency cases. Read: ""Marie Stopes Kenya, an organisation that provides quality, affordable reproductive health care to poor, vulnerable, and the under-served populations has also been banned from providing reproductive health information by the KFCB,"" read a statement. ""This follows allegations that the charity was promoting abortion through a radio campaign they ran on Radio Africa."" In Kenya, abortion is allowed if in the opinion of a medical provider a woman’s life or health is at risk, or in emergency situations. Post-abortion care is essential emergency care, care to which every woman is entitled. Marie Stopes said the action by the KMPDU and the KFCB undermine women's and girls’ access to reproductive health services. It also denies them information, including access to safe and legal abortion and violates their human rights, the firm said. ""In addition, the ban by the medical board has had a chilling effect on healthcare service providers who are now in fear of providing these essential, life-saving services for fear of harassment and prosecution,"" Marie Stopes said. In the petition, Marie Stopes said an estimated 464,690 women got an abortion in Kenya in 2012 and nearly 120,000 women were admitted to public health facilities that year for severe complications. According to a study conducted by African Population and Health Research Centre and the Ministry of Health, unsafe abortion accounts for a quarter of maternal deaths in Kenya. ""Any ban on reproductive health services is a violation of the Constitution and fundamental human rights and is an affront to women and girls,"" said Evelyne Opondo, senior regional director for Africa, at the Centre for Reproductive Rights. ""We have seen that when governments limit or prevent qualified healthcare providers from providing abortion services, women and girls are forced to pursue unsafe and harmful alternatives,"" she said. Opondo said women of reproductive age need to access information that will enable them to make informed decisions about their bodies and lives. ""It is, therefore, the government’s obligation to put in place policies and guidelines that address access to safe abortion services and ensure the full implementation of those policies,” Opondo said. She argues that women are dying from complications and disabilities that arise from unsafe abortion, yet these deaths are easily preventable. Opondo wants the government to show commitment towards addressing the issue of unsafe abortion to reduce the high rates of maternal mortality. Read: A report by the United Nations Population Fund shows that 378, 397 adolescent girls became pregnant between July 2016 and June 2017. More specifically, there were 28,932 girls aged 10-14 and 349,465 girls aged 15-19 who became pregnant. Since 2015, the Centre for Reproductive Rights and other activists in Kenya have been in court challenging the withdrawal of the standards and guidelines that were meant to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality arising from unsafe abortion. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a case against the Attorney General, the ministry and the Director of Medical Services on behalf of the Federation of Women Lawyers, two community human rights mobilisers, and an adolescent rape survivor, who has since died from complications of unsafe abortion. The centre is urging the High Court to protect women’s health and lives by restoring safe abortion trainings. It also wants the Ministry of Health to introduce standards and guidelines that appropriately clarify when legal abortion can be provided. The final hearing for the standards and guidelines case is scheduled for next week at the High Court.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-12-01-abortion-rights-group-sues-ministry-officials-over-marie-stopes-ban/
120,True,True,9.0,By Annete Wambulwa,01 December 2018 - 00:30,,"Youth lobby defends Marie Stopes abortion services, sues ministry",,"The impasse between Marie Stopes and the Ministry of Health over the recent ban on abortion at their facilities is far from over. A lobby has sued the ministry for the decision and wants its directives nullified. In November 14, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board barred Marie Stopes Kenya from offering any form of abortion services in all its 23 facilities. Marie Stopes was also directed to submit a report of the reviewed guidelines “to conform with the law within the next 60 days”. On Friday, Network for Adolescents and Youth of Africa filed a petition at the Milimani law courts. It seeks to suspend the decision by the Director of Medical Services that stopped provision of post-abortion care services by Marie Stopes. The NGO wants the court to quash the decision by the Kenya Film Classification Board to ban advertisement related to the public awareness campaign on comprehensive reproductive health services undertaken by Marie Stopes Kenya in conjunction with Radio Africa Group. It wants the government barred from “making public utterances on abortion services, unless the same is accurate, scientifically and factually sound and does not perpetuate stigma against legal abortion services”. According to Naya, the decision violates the Constitution, specifically the right to life and health. The organisation says because of the ban, women and girls who present themselves in Marie Stopes clinics in need of urgent medical emergency care in the form of safe abortion and post-abortion care cannot access lawful, vital, lifesaving services. Read: “The ban is a deterrent for any woman or girl in Kenya from accessing safe abortion and post-abortion services owing to the misinformation it communicates and resultant chilling effect on health service providers who offer safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care services,” the petition reads. The lobby argues that there is a real danger of deaths resulting from lack of emergency medical treatment. Any inordinate delay may worsen medical emergency, it says. It has lashed out at the KMPDU and KFCB chief executive officer Ezekiel Mutua for stopping the public awareness campaign on comprehensive reproductive health between Marie Stopes and Radio Africa Group. The petition seeks to have the Health ministry compelled to “proactively and fully disclose and make widely available and accessibly information on legal abortion services that is accurate, timely, transparent, and devoid of moral, religious or other bias”. The information should include facilities offering abortion and post-abortion services and grounds of eligibility for the services.

121,True,True,9.0,THE CONVERSATION,07 December 2018 - 09:00,,Why Marie Stopes ban may drive more women to unsafe abortions,,"The Kenyan Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board has stopped the NGO Marie Stopes International from performing abortions in Kenya. Marie Stopes is a global organisation that provides contraception and safe abortion to women in urban and rural communities. Abortion in Kenya, unless a trained medical professional judges that there’s a need for emergency treatment, or that a woman’s life or health is in danger. The Conversation Africa’s Moina Spooner spoke to Michael Mutua about the Marie Stopes ban and its implications. How did the ban come about? According to the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, they banned abortion services provided by Marie Stopes from the general public. The public the organisation was running pro-choice media campaigns. These adverts specifically sought to provide women with a solution when faced with crisis pregnancies. The adverts were also criticised by the Kenya Film Classification Board, which ordered Marie Stopes to pull them down for allegedly promoting abortion. The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board is the only body within the Ministry of Health that has the mandate to regulate and set policies on medical training and service provision in the public and private sectors. Aside from closing down the abortion services, the board also ordered that Marie Stopes file all its service reports with them for two months. This is a way for them to keep track of what services the NGO is providing. Under what circumstances are abortions legal or illegal in Kenya? Abortion in Kenya is guided by two laws. Kenya’s 2010 Constitution unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger. Health can complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing; it’s not just related to physical factors. So factors like social pressures and the psychological and emotional distress associated with unwanted pregnancies are taken into account. But there to be confusion over this for women, medical practitioners and legal bodies. That’s because, since this constitution came into effect, no policy guidelines have been created about the provision of safe legal abortion in Kenya. These guidelines would clearly define the circumstances under which the medical practitioner can do an abortion and what type of medical practitioner is authorised to perform the procedure. These guidelines used to exist – but they were withdrawn soon after the launch of the constitution following an outcry from religious groups. The Ministry of Health that the guidelines were prone to misuse by quack medics. Without these guidelines, the older law comes into effect. This law practically criminalises the act of seeking or securing abortion. It is harsher on the service provider than on the woman who terminates a pregnancy. The law can penalise the service provider with up to 14 years in jail. The patient can get seven years. The penal code does allow surgical intervention when the life of the mother is in danger. But this is very invasive and doesn’t accommodate improved procedures manual vacuum aspiration and medical abortion. How many abortions happen in Kenya every year, and how? The impact of these laws means that women often turn to backstreet clinics and unsafe abortion services. Abortion is highly stigmatised within communities and at health facilities so women prefer to take a risk to assure their privacy. A by the Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the African Population and Health Research Center, revealed that about 465,000 unsafe abortions take place in Kenya every year. As a result, nearly 120,000 women are treated in health facilities each year for complications arising from unsafe abortions. These include incomplete abortion, infection, excessive bleeding and injury to the internal organs. The risk of maternal mortality is high. Over 77% of these cases presented are “moderate or severe” and the women are at a high risk of death. What will the impact of the ban be? Each year the over US$5million to treat women in government facilities who have complications from unsafe abortion. This cost is high. But it’s actually an underestimation: it excludes social costs – like the loss of working hours – and out-of-pocket expenses covered by the patient or their friends and relatives. Non-governmental players – like Marie Stopes – that provide safe abortions make a significant in preventing the risks of maternal morbidity and mortality. One of the main roles they play is in preventing unintended pregnancies by providing contraception. These organisations also provide quality counselling to patients who intend to secure abortion. However some patients, given their social situations and because of the stigma of an unintended pregnancy, will resort to unsafe abortion when safe options aren’t available. I anticipate that by curtailing safe abortion services, without a commensurate investment in the prevention of unintended pregnancies, there will be an increase in the incidence and magnitude of complications from unsafe abortion in Kenya.

He said abortion allows girls to turn into sluts through reckless sexand amounts to permitting the devil to take charge of families. “Don’t let Satan take over the shelter of life. Don’t let Satan control the source of life, our dear women. When Satan takes control, we are all lost,” Muheria said during mass at Our Lady of Africa Cathedral Church in Kitui town. “Mothers should talk to their children and fathers must be on the lookout to establish what their children are up to.” Abortion is illegal in Kenya. The Constitution says that it can only be performed on mothers endangered by a pregnancy. Muheria said it is better to pray for a pregnant teenager than allow her to kill her unborn baby. He appealed to parents and guardians to uphold moral standards and impart good values to children so Kenya can be a virtuous society. “We must help them by being close and friendly. We must be wary as we pray for them,” he said. The cleric cautioned parents against abdicating their role. Some 113 Kitui girls who sat KCSE exam were either pregnant or had children. The District Health Information Systems report says 8,656 girls became pregnant in the county last year. Read: Muheria urged the faithful to join him in prayer so Marie Stopes Clinic can be prohibited from carrying out abortions. “If you see that signboard, go there and pray for God to hear the cries of our children who die in their clinic. They should be sent away to do their work in Europe and the US,” he said. The clinic had been advocating safe abortion. Last month, the government banned it from offering abortion services. Kenya country director Dana Tilson said other family planning, maternal health and general care services were unaffected. The Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, citing complaints from the public, also blocked the clinic from publishing misleading information on its website. The organisation was further barred from running advertisements that violate the Public Health Facilities Advertising Rules, 2016.

123,True,True,0.0,JOHN MUCHANGI,18 December 2018 - 03:00,,"Sign the Maputo protocol now, 14 African countries told",,"Calls for 14 African countries to ratify the Maputo Protocol on the Rights of Women and Girls gathered momentum at the African Union headquarters, with the AU organs, the African Union Commission chairperson and 41 member states urging their peers to expeditiously ratify the instrument. During the meeting, it emerged that Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Madagascar, Niger, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, South Sudan, Somalia and Sudan had signed but not ratified the Protocol, while Botswana, Egypt and Morocco were found to be lagging behind as they had neither signed nor ratified the Protocol, despite the 2020 deadline. The Protocol, which was adopted by the AU 15 years ago, seeks to protect women and girls from legal and social violations of their rights and fundamental freedoms that remain widespread across the continent. The meeting adopted a new initiative by the AU dubbed ""All for Maputo Protocol"" that seeks to accelerate signing, ratification, domestication and implementation of the Protocol. It will include in-country Advocacy Missions to Member States that are yet to ratify the Protocol. This will help provide understanding of the challenges that these countries are facing in ratifying the instrument and identify opportunities to facilitate ratification. In a speech read on his behalf, the Ghanaian President and AU Leader on Gender and Development in Africa Nana Akufo-Addo lauded Ethiopia and Rwanda for their role in enhancing women participation in decision making and political processes. He observed that Rwanda had become the world’s reference point in as far as women’s representation was concerned. “I commit to ensuring that the African Union Commission becomes a role model for women rights and empowerment,” he said. Kenya has already signed and ratified the Maputo Protocol. Recently, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori said Kenya should lift its reservations on Article 14 (2) (c) of the protocol and allow abused women to undergo abortions. The Maputo Protocol states that governments must put in place mechanisms to procure abortions for women impregnated through sexual assault, rape or incest. At the Addis meeting, AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat reiterated his support towards gender equality and pledged to be a role model and champion for the Protocol, calling on the remaining states to ratify the Protocol. On her part, Faiza Mohamed, Africa Director of international women's rights organisation Equality Now, explained that while some advancements had been made in the promotion of the rights of women and girls in Africa, more remains to be done in order to realise the aspirations of the Protocol. Mohamed pointed out that although African nations were obliged to fully uphold the rights of women and girls, accounts of sexual and gender based violence, sexual exploitation, harmful cultural practices such as Female Genital Mutilation and “early child” marriages, systemic inequalities and lack of access to reproductive services and healthcare continue to take place. She observed that the universal ratification of the Protocol would go a long way in holding governments to account for these wrongs. She said: “Every day, girls as young as seven are robbed off their childhood through the harmful and continuous practice that Female Genital Mutilation remains. Our daughters are forced to become wives and mothers while they are still children. Africa has been synonymous with horrific stories and it is time to put a stop to this narrative. It is good that we have committed ourselves on paper but now we must move past the rhetoric and begin to collectively action our promises.” The Maputo Protocol was adopted in 2003 as an African regional treaty affirming women’s rights to exercise self-determination and bodily autonomy; free of discrimination, coercion and violence. It explicitly draws from and builds upon existing United Nations international human rights law and authoritative guidance, while contextualizing it to women in Africa.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018-12-18-sign-the-maputo-protocol-now-14-african-countries-told/

The conditions, which are aimed at stiffening the regulation of reproductive health services in the country, were issued by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board on November 14. Citing safety risks, the board imposed a ban restricting the reproductive health clinic from conducting abortions in the country. Read: But Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, in a notice in the dailies on Friday, said the clinic has complied with the orders. She ordered the ban lifted. Among the conditions that the CS said the clinic has met include deactivating its 0800 toll free number and withdrawing the adverts on abortion. According to Sicily, Marie Stopes has also submitted ""100 samples patient files from various facilities to the board for review and examination."" The CS noted that Marie Stopes will only be allowed to dispense abortion service as required by the law which only allows situations where the health of the mother is in danger. ""They will also be required to commit in writing to the Medical practitioners and dentists' board that they will not procure any abortion on demand in the country,"" the said in a statement. The ban was lifted after a review found the clinic had not actively encouraged women and girls to have abortions, a move that will prevent many unsafe terminations. Kenya n authorities had directed Marie Stopes to suspend abortions and post-abortion care after complaints a media campaign run by the charity promoted abortions - a charge it denied. Abortions are not permitted in Kenya unless a woman's life or health is in danger and emergency treatment is required, a rule campaigners say has led many women to resort to unsafe illegal terminations. Marie Stopes said its media campaign was aimed at creating public awareness of Kenya's high rates of unsafe abortion, and after an audit, Kenya 's health ministry said last week the group was ""in total compliance"" with the country's laws. Almost half a million abortions were conducted in Kenya in 2012 - mostly in backstreet clinics - with one in four women and girls suffering complications such as high fever, sepsis, shock and organ failure, said a February health ministry report. An estimated 266 women die per 100,000 unsafe abortions in Kenya - higher than rates estimated in other east African nations, it added. Marie Stopes - which has worked in Kenya for more than three decades and has 22 clinics across the east African nation - said it would continue to work closely with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, which implemented the ban. ""We are grateful to the Board for recognising this as a serious issue, and for their commitment to ensuring that women have the safe healthcare they so desperately need,"" a spokeswoman said in emailed comments. This is not the first time Marie Stopes - which works in 37 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America as well as the United States - has faced a suspension or closure over its abortion services. Campaigners took to Twitter to protest Kenya's ban on social media, saying it would drive many to makeshift clinics and put lives at risk. ""By mobilising against the ban on abortion on social media, women made it clear that they will not sit idly by as the government attempts to roll back their rights and access to health care,"" said Erin Williams from the US-based charity International Women's Health Coalition. Nearly half of an estimated 56 million abortions conducted each year are unsafe, leading to the deaths of at least 22,800 women, a global report by the Guttmacher Institute said in March.

A UN report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition says drought and floods have contributed to hunger in Kenya and Africa. Food insecurity, inadequate access to nutrient-rich foods, high disease prevalence and poor sanitation are among factors that prompt malnutrition. Northern Kenyan has been cited as a region with severe malnutrition due to prolonged drought. The report says, “For those whose livelihoods depend on livestock, climate shocks can lead to depleted income and food resources due to loss of animals, milk production and trade.” Many livestock diseases such as the Rift Valley Fever outbreak in 2006-07 can be linked to extreme climate. RVF outbreaks and patterns are closely associated with shifts from El Niño to La Niña. In East Africa, more than half of El Niño occurrences have been accompanied by corresponding RVF outbreaks. The RVF outbreak in Northeastern killed more than 420,000 sheep and goats. The projected milk losses were estimated to be more than 2.5 million litres due to abortions in cattle and camels. Kenya also faced severe food crisis between 2011-12 during the East Africa drought. The UN report further says the drought combined with rising global food prices led to the collapse of livelihoods for 9.5 million people. Small-scale farmers who produce 69 per cent of the country’s food are listed among those most vulnerable to climatic shocks. The climatic variations hurt farmers as they have less food for consumption and sale. Kenya, an emerging economy, has an uphill task in implementing much-needed agrarian reforms and ensuring food security for her citizens, columnist Qureish Raghib says. The issue is a core feature in catalysing economic growth, and is a principal constituent in perpetrating judicious governance. Indeed, there would not be a better time than now to provide impetus to the concern of food security. The prevalent global financial crisis has constrained the availability of capital at a time when greater investment is urgently needed in the agriculture segment. World economies continue to opt for alternative capital ventures in a bid to achieve greater per capita income in favour of per capita calorie consumption. It is justified to infer that economic success should not be defined by the price of food but by the provision of adequate and nutritious food for the people",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/09/13/climate-shocks-to-blame-for-food-crisis_c1817149

One Nairobi University student says, “Foetuses are collected from dustbins in universities. Most girls do not seek safe abortion services, including post-abortion care, as they fear being known to have aborted.” In another report published by safeabortionswomensright.org, it was found that not only are women dying from complications but health professionals are also being affected. In one case, a nurse received a client that came seeking medical help after a botched abortion and who died soon after. While he insists that the woman had undergone the abortion elsewhere, he was arrested and sentenced to death. He is waiting for an appeal. In another case, in 2011, a 40-year old woman was held in Murang’a police station for allegedly having an abortion by swallowing chemicals. Instead of getting medical help, she was locked in the cell where she died after developing complications. In an even more alarming incident, a 21-year-old woman was arrested for attempting to have an abortion. She was marched to the nearby chief’s camp with a crowd assaulting her and calling her names, all while carrying a basin full of blood and the fetus.

This uncertainty meant that there were three court cases every week where women were charged with having an illegal abortion, and studies showed that 10 out of 20 cases examined involved schoolgirls – some of whom were minors. “An unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards or both,” says Dr Caroline Tatua, a senior health systems adviser.

I know they would say that I was careless, but I knew I could not have a child. I was 16, a child myself, but I remembered my sister and I knew I couldn’t do it the way she had. I could not leave my mother on her own.” For Sarah the memory of her sisters’ death was still fresh in her mind, it was after all, only two years later. She was in the same position as her sister, unable to support a child and unwilling to disappoint her mother. “I was scared! I thought that they would cut me and that I would die. But I didn’t know who to talk to or where to go. In the end I called the Marie Stopes hotline who sent me to a good clinic where a doctor helped me. He told me what to expect and what I needed to do. I was lucky, it was still early so they gave me some pills,” she adds. “I think that’s why my sister went to that butcher. She didn’t know what else to do. She didn’t know what would happen. She was scared. “I don’t regret doing what I did. I know people may judge me, but I could not have had that child. It would not have been fair to the child and myself. I think about it everyday though. Would it have been a boy or girl? What would it have looked like? “But I know that now I’ve almost finished school, I can get a better job and make enough money to have a family. I know I will never forget it. It was not an easy decision to make, it should not be an easy decision to make. But it was mine.” While Sarah’s story may have ended on a positive note, lack of access to a safe abortion or even information on reproductive health is resulting in the deaths of thousands of Kenyan women and girls every year. The World Health Organization recommends the use of four misoprostol tablets and one mifepristone tablet for the safe termination of a pregnancy under nine weeks. A minor surgical procedure can also be used by a trained health professional. The social stigma around abortion and lack of service delivery policies are pushing women to resort to quacks (backstreet or untrained providers). Unintended pregnancies are the main cause of unsafe abortions. The high number of unwanted pregnancies stems largely from the unmet need for family planning, which currently stands at 18 per cent. Various organisations offer pregnancy crisis counselling services which can assist women and girls in desperate situations so that they avoid endangering themselves. This matter therefore needs to be brought to the fore, otherwise we shall continue to lose more women and girls over an issue that can be resolved.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/09/18/dangers-of-unsafe-abortions_c1837479

131,True,True,9.0,Annette Wambulwa @WambulwaAnnette,02 January 2019 - 00:00,,"Condoms, abortions, LGBT rights: Controversial cases filed in court this year",,"As the year ends, there are several cases which stand out having been filed in court which have caught the eye of the public and have been a trending topic on all social media platforms. The recent ban of abortion at the Maries Stopes Clinics countrywide drew mixed reactions on social media with some supporting the move and the other half condemning the decision. A reproductive health organization then moved to court in a bid to lift the orders issued by the board arguing that KMPDU and the KFCB undermine women's and girls’ access to reproductive health services. The lobby group argued that the had a chilling effect on healthcare service providers who are now in fear of providing these essential, life-saving services for fear of harassment and prosecution. It was also their argument that it is the government’s obligation to put in place policies and guidelines that address access to safe abortion services and ensure the full implementation of those policies. “Women are dying from complications and disabilities that arise from unsafe abortion, yet these deaths are easily preventable. The government must show commitment towards addressing the issue of unsafe abortion to reduce the high rates of maternal mortality.” They argued. The center is urging the High Court to protect women’s health and lives by restoring safe abortion trainings. It also wants the Ministry of Health to introduce standards and guidelines that appropriately clarify when legal abortion can be provided. According to research, unsafe abortion accounts for a quarter of maternal deaths in Kenya and that’s the reason why the lobby group wants the court to lift the orders. In the Kenyan law, abortion is only allowed if in the opinion of a medical provider, a woman’s life or health is at risk, or in emergency situations. The Lobby group says that estimated 464,690 women got an abortion in Kenya in 2012 and nearly 120,000 women were admitted to public health facilities that year for severe complications resulting from unsafe abortions. The case is still pending in court and the court is expected to rule whether Marie stops will resume operations or not. Meanwhile, in another related case, the same lobby group alongside FIDA Kenya have also challenged the move by the Ministry of Health to withdraw guidelines on safe abortion saying it’s a violation of their rights. A five judge bench comprising of Justices Aggrey Muchelule, Mumbi Ngugi, George Odunga, Lydia Achode and John Mativo is expected to make a ruling on the said move by the state and it will be a big win for the lobby groups if the guidelines are reinstated by the court. This year also saw a huge win for the LGBT community in Kenya after the high court lifted the ban of the Rafiki Film which had been blacklisted by KFCB and banned from showing in the cinemas. Rafiki which is an acclaimed film portraying a lesbian romance and that it the reason why the Kenya Film Classification Board banned it over its homosexual theme. The film director moved to court in a bid to lift the ban so that she could screen it in Kenya being one of the requirements for submitting it for the Oscars Awards. Rafiki which has received accolades and condemnation in the same measure tells the story of a romantic lesbian couple in the Kenyan set up which is not the norm. In her application to court, Kahiu argued that the ban had made it impossible for her to submit the film for review by the Oscars Selection Committee Kenya for consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category award. Justice Wilfrida Okwany lifted the ban temporarily for seven days for adults only so that Kahiu could qualify to submit to the Oscars. Even though they lost out at the nominations it was a big win for the gay and lesbian community who argue that 10 years ago no judge could give such an order. The case still pending before court and it remains to be seen what the court will rule on whether the movie ban which is still in force will be lifted. The Gay couples in Kenya are also awaiting with baited breath for the courts decision in their case where the director of National Gay and Lesbian Rights Commission Eric Gitari is seeking to decriminalize Sections 162 and 165 of the Penal Code. Sections 162 (a) and (c) says that any person who has ‘carnal knowledge against the order of nature’ or permits a person to have ‘carnal knowledge against the order of nature’ against them has committed a crime. The Gay community hopes the three judge bench comprising of Justices Roselyn Aburili, Chacha Mwita and John Mativo will rule in their favour and repel the section just as the Supreme Court of India did a few months ago in their landmark ruling. Gitari argues that the sections are discriminatory and violate various provisions of the Constitution. These include right to equality, freedom from discrimination, human dignity, freedom and security of the person and right to privacy. He argues that the law criminalizing relevant conduct such as unnatural and grossly indecent are so degrading since its consensual sex among consenting adults. The government on its part has maintained that they will not legalized homosexuality and has asked the court to dismiss the case. They argue that declaring sections 162 and 165 of the penal code as unconstitutional would tantamount to allowing unnatural offenses between people of the same gender who may have a legitimate expectation to enter into a marriage which is contrary of Article 45 of the constitution. According to the state, allowing unnatural acts on basis that it is done in private will be tearing the social fabric of the Kenyan society further arguing that the privacy is not an excuse to commit a crime. In the case, Christian and Muslims organization have also opposed the case by the homosexuals urging the court to throw out the case. Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata has also been enjoined in the matter and he also strongly opposed the move claiming that culturally homosexuality was not allowed and it’s against the norm. The ruling for the case is scheduled for this month. The case that trended for days was one where a man sued Beta Healthcare seeking damages for a selling him a substandard condom that broke during intercourse. He said that when he bought the condom he believed it would please his partner and fully protect him but it burst. He claims that as a result he ended up infecting his wife, who has since left him, with a sexually transmitted infection. “That I was fully aware of the dangers of having unprotected sex and decided to use my favorite brand of condoms, being the Zoom scented chocolate-flavoured studded condoms, which I believed would please the woman and protect me fully,” he said. The man claims that he was also informed by his friends that some of them had experienced the condom breaks from the same brand of condoms. However, in a twist of events, the Beta Healthcare has claimed that he could have worn the size and condoms since they come in many sizes. In their response to his case against them, the company says that condoms come in sizes and every man, depending on how much endowed or less endowed, ought to use the right size. ""I am aware of the fact that if one puts on a condom that does not match his size, there is a high chance of rupturing,"" the company said. They also said the man cannot be trusted since he cannot prove that he indeed bought zoom condoms as he claims. The company wants the court to dismiss the man's case as it is a waste of judicial time. In Beta’s view, the man cannot be believed because though he claims to be married, he seems to have cheated on his wife with many women. ""The petitioner is solely responsible for his misfortunes and he cannot assert that Beta is responsible for his marital problems, mental distress, alcoholism and the loss of his job,"" they told court. The case is still ongoing and the stressed man who claims to have lost everything due to the condom burst is hopeful the court will given him damages for what he went through.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-01-02-condoms-abortions-lgbt-rights-controversial-cases-filed-in-court-this-year/
132,True,True,1.0,MELANIE MWANGI @mwangimelanie,14 January 2019 - 15:00,,Rastafarians: The bhang-smoking 'chosen group',,"A Rastafarian man has hit the headlines after he went to court on Monday to compel Olympic High School in Kibra constituency to admit his daughter chased away for wearing dreadlocks. The man argues that his daughter wears dreadlocks as part of her Rastafarian religion and not as a fashion statement and should therefore not be compelled to shave them off. The minor was sent away on January 10 despite having paid school fees. More on this read: So what is Rastafarianism? Rastafarianism is an African-centred religion developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of Haile Selassie I as King of Ethiopia in 1930. Rastafarians consider Haile Selassie as their god and believe he will return to free members of the black community who are living in exile as a result of colonisation and slave trade. The theology was developed from Marcus Garvey, a political activist who wanted to improve the status of black people. How it spread It, however, spread globally following the success of the late Bob Marley and his music in the 1970s. Rastafarians believe that blacks are the chosen people of God, but through colonisation and slave trade their role has been suppressed to that of an inferior position as the slaves of whites. They believe the persecution resulted in their expulsion from Ethiopia to Jamaica, but they will eventually be returned to their homeland, Africa. Other names Rastafarians also go by the names rastas, sufferers, locks-men, dreads or dreadlocks. They regard themselves as the genuine Israelites. They have various beliefs some of which are mirrored in the Old Testament laws. They are; 1. No sharp implements to be used to damage man, for example , no trimming or shaving, no tattooing of the skin or cutting of the flesh. 2. As foretold in Leviticus 21:5: ""They shall not make baldness upon their heads, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh."" They instead grow it and twist it into dreadlocks. 3. Vegetarianism: Rastafarians use as little animal flesh as possible. They avoid eating pig flesh, shellfish, scaleless fish or snails. 4. Worship and recognise no God other than Haile Selassie, and reject pagan beliefs, without disrespecting believers. 5. Love all mankind, but make one's first love the sons of Ham. 6. Condemn hate, jealousy, envy, deceit, craftiness, treachery, etc. 7. Oppose the pleasures of modern day society. 8. Create a world of one brotherhood. 9. Be charitable to any afflicted Rastafarian brother, and latterly to any other human, animal, plant, etc. 10. Adhere to the ancient laws of Ethiopia. 11. Do not accept aid, titles or possessions that the enemy might impart upon you, in fear. One's main purpose is to uphold Rastafari. Other beliefs Some of their other religious practices are inhalation of marijuana in order to increase spiritual awareness, chanting, drumming and meditating in order to reach a state of heightened spirituality and abstaining from alcohol. They are also opposed to abortion and contraception and believe reincarnation follows death and that life is eternal. The religion's colours are red, green and gold and sometimes black is added. Red signifies the blood of those killed for the cause of the black community, throughout Jamaican history, green represents Jamaica's vegetation and hope for the eradication of suppression, gold symbolises the wealth of Ethiopia and black signifies the colour of the Africans who initiated Rastafari. Their symbol is a lion which represents Haile Selassie I, who is referred to as the 'Conquering Lion of Judah'. Rastafarians' dreadlocks represent the lion's mane. With the number of Rastafarians increasing including in the West, some of the beliefs are not adhered to. However, for most Rastafarians, it remains a strongly held belief.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-01-14-rastafarians-the-bhang-smoking-chosen-group/

EACC insiders opened up to the Star about their troubles as new anti-graft czar Twalib Mbarak took over yesterday for the next six years. Mbarak, a former military intelligence officer, was sworn into office at the Supreme Court by Chief Justice David Maraga. Multiple sources told the Star Mbarak will have to spearhead a radical house cleaning at Integrity Centre to succeed. The EACC’s intelligence division is dysfunctional as it is headed by an incompetent person. As a result, the commission mainly relies on whistleblowers, media reports and public pressure to commence investigations. Bureaucratic red tape in the investigation chain has also been cited for long delay in investigations and the bungling of some critical cases. Once a case is lodged at the agency, it is assigned to a team who gauge its merits. If the complaint is compelling, it is then assigned investigators. Once the investigations are over, the file is taken to the team leader, who analyses and forwards it to the departmental head of investigation. If the head of investigations gives the nod, the file is sent to the legal department. From there the file is forwarded to the deputy CEO and head of operations. “This long chain opens the process to unnecessary delays and possible massive interference. It has made even a simple graft case that can be tied together in a day to take over six months. Others collapse,” a source said. The feeling among some EACC insiders is that the long chain should be abolished and the teams made to work together. “And once the file is ready it should come directly from the investigation directorate to the CEO for onward processing,” an insider said. Mbarak has also been urged to spearhead vetting of staff that aborted in 2016. Ex-EACC chairman Philip Kinisu had insisted that all EACC staff be vetted to ascertain their suitability but he left office before the exercise was done. “EACC has been designed to fail and the top officials at the secretariat make sure this status quo remains,” another source said. They have converted the agency into a protection unit for persons who loot public coffers, the source said. The secretariat is said to have been deliberately weakened by poor placement, parallel reporting procedures and skewed employment based on patronage and ethnicity. The new boss will also be confronted by the challenge of investigating his own staff. Some EACC top dogs have been adversely mentioned in scandals, with others accused of either hiding files or compromising investigations. Also top on the list for Mbarak will be to normalise strained relations between EACC and other investigating agencies especially the DPP and DCI.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-01-15-anti-corruption-agency-is-designed-to-fail-must-be-reformed-insiders/
134,True,False,0.0,JAMES MBAKA @onchirimbaka,30 January 2019 - 06:00,,Magufuli blocked Raila’s ceremony in Tanzania,,"Controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna has laid bare how Tanzanian President John Magufuli allegedly blocked NASA leader Raila Odinga from being sworn as the ‘People’s President’ in Tanzania. Highlighting the behind the scenes intrigues behind the aborted December 12 and the January 30 swearing in ceremonies in his new book ‘Treason’, Miguna says Magufuli decline the request and even opposed the whole plan. Miguna explains how ""his"" National Revolutionary Movement of Kenya (NRM-Ke) committee proposed to swear Raila at the Kenyan Embassy in Ghana or Tanzania. The two foreign missions, according to Miguna, were a fallback plan should the government have cracked down on NASA and blocked his swearing in at a venue in Nairobi. “The NRMKe team had proposed that if we were unable to conduct the function in a public space such as Uhuru Park in Nairobi, which was the preferred venue then we could do it at a Kenyan Embassy in Ghana or Tanzania. The second option was to hold it either in Kakamega, or Kilifi, or Mombasa,” Miguna reveals in his new book, Treason: The Case Against Tyrants & Renegades.’ Read: The Kenyan-born lawyer with Canadian citizenship, says Raila had tasked his trusted ally and Siaya senator James Orengo to speak to President Magufuli about the possibility of holding the ceremony in Tanzania. According to the book, ‘ Miguna says president Magufuli who has close personal ties with Raila, flatly opposed the whole swearing in plan. The self-declared NRM General writes in the newly released book: “According to Orengo, Magufuli believed that leadership was ‘a gift from God’ and that if God had not given Raila that gift, there was no reason to pursue our plans and that Raila should forget about being sworn in as The People’s President,” reads an excerpt from the book launched on Saturday. Miguna says the statements were interpreted to mean that Magufuli was of the view that God did not want Raila to be the president of Kenya. “I found such statements to be outrageous. God had not manipulated the August 8, 2017 General Election,” Miguna says in his explosive book. God had neither established a weak IEBC, threatened and/or bribed its commissioners and secretarial staff, threatened the Kenyan judiciary, he notes. “God was not guilty of switching off the IEBC kiems kits, infiltrating and posting altered numbers on the IEBC server, nor was he responsible for refusing to give access to the IEBC server as had been ordered by the Supreme Court of Kenya,” the controversial lawyer says. In his usual provocative style of writing, Miguna exposes the behind the scenes intrigues that marred the events that preceded Raila’s January 30 swearing in at Uhuru park grounds. Revisiting the initially planned swearing in event of December 12, to coincide with the Jamuhuri day celebrations, Miguna says Raila had engaged a reverse gear and developed cold feet. Miguna calls the bluff on Raila saying while the NASA leader had publicly demonstrated commitment to be sworn in on Jamhuri day, he was again engaging reverse gears and slowing down the process. Read: He recalls the events of December 9 when while watching an Arsenal soccer match at businessman Jimmy Wanjigi’s Muthaiga home, Raila broke news to them that his co-principals had actually asked that the December 12 swearing in be postponed. Early in the day Miguna had been summoned to former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama’s house where he spent five hours drafting the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party chief’s inaugural speech and oath. He adds that, after the speech was reviewed and approved by both Muthama and Orengo, they were driven to prominent businessman Jimmy Wanjigi’s mansion in Muthaiga where he later learnt that they were supposed to swear in Odinga on that very day. “Mudavadi and Weta are insisting that we postpone... They are going to address the media at Okoa Kenya just now,” Miguna quotes Raila telling them after a lengthy telephone conversation. Miguna says Raila had left them in the room with Orengo and former Machakos senator Johnstone Muthama, and escused himself to answer to phone call before returning with the shocking news. “Muthama tried to support the postponement, but Wanjigi and I did not let him get far. Orengo was blowing hot and cold. Winnie said nothing in front of Raila,” Miguna narrates in his book. He adds, “ Wanjigi was livid, or so I believed. He reminded Raila of the expectations of millions of his supporters. Then Mudavadi, Wetang’ula and Makueni Governor, Kivutha Kibwana came on TV,” recalls Miguna. Miguna says that he challenged Raila to explain his innocence lividly because according to him the statement was not a surprise and appeared to have been a well-choreographed script. “Raila tried to give us excuses, claiming that Mudavadi, Wetang’ula and Kivutha acted alone; that they only informed him minutes before they had addressed the media,” says Miguna. Miguna says he would have believed Raila if only Mudavadi, Wetang’ula or Kibwana had addressed the press from their private offices or homes — individually. Instead, he says, the press conference we were watching on TV was jointly being addressed by two of Raila’s co-principles with Kibwana representing Kalonzo who was still in Germany. “It was held at the OKOA Kenya office in the presence of Raila’s fifth columnists like Ndii, Ong’wen and Ole Kina,” he adds. Miguna also notes how, during a committee meeting on November 28, 2017, at a top hotel in Westlands, Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho had strongly suggested that the swearing in ceremony be held in Kilifi. “He (Joho) said that the Mijikenda were warriors, just like the Turkana, Pokot or Samburu, and that if the police or any other state security agents tried to disrupt the event in Kilifi, ‘the Mijikenda would unleash hellfire on them,’” reads yet another excerpt.

The prosecution said they were not ready to issue plea to the accused person because the police had not completed investigations. Rongai DCI boss Dorcas Cherui wanted the suspects detained for 10 days as police investigate charges of incitement to violence, arson and malicious damage of property. “Investigation requires humble time.

Caroline worked for Dandora Community Justice Centre, a human rights lobby that fights against extrajudicial killings, police brutality and enforced disappearances. It has been documenting police executions in the estate and its environs. “Saying that Caro died from an abortion operation gone wrong is hogwash. We’ve been with her and we know that she was not pregnant,” Mbai said. Husband Joshua Ochieng’ expressed dismay at the allegations, saying the abortion theory could not hold. “If she was supposedly aborting for fear of ruining her marriage, why would she wait to do that after five months?” he asked. “Why didn’t she do it in the first month or two or even less?” Read: More: Mbai questioned the credibility of the records at the morgue. He said his family and friends had visited the morgue and conducted a thorough search from February 8 but did not find the body. They also visited other mortuaries. “We were here on February 8 and 9 but did not find her. We asked about Caroline. If there was a body by the name Caroline, we could have been shown so we identify her,” the father of four said. The mortuary attendants had explained on Tuesday that a woman only identified as Grace took the activist’s body to the facility on February 7. Asked on Tuesday to disclose the attendant who was in charge, they said the staff had taken leave. Records show the body was booked as Carolyne Mbeki. It is not clear how they arrived at the name. Human rights activists, led by Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid and Dandora Community Justice Centre coordinator Wilfred Olal, took issue with “the police providing information to the media regarding the discovery of the body, even before informing the family.” “How did they know that the name assigned to the discovered body was wrong? How is that they found it right to tip the media of the discovery but not informing the family who had reported a missing person?” Olal asked. Activist Florence Kanyua asked why the postmortem planned for yesterday was pushed to next Monday, with an excuse that chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor was in Naivasha. “It is them who told us that the postmortem would be carried out today? Why was it postponed to Monday? Is Oduor the only pathologist who can do it?” she asked. The Star learnt that Oduor was in Arusha. It later emerged that the postmortem is to be done today. Khalid said, “They told us when I was here with Houghton Irungu [Transparency International director] that they would do the autopsy at 9am. We have even come with our independent pathologist to work together with theirs.

An autopsy on Thursday revealed she bled to death from a ruptured uterus. Activist Caroline Mwatha died from excessive bleeding caused by a possible abortion, an independent pathologist said. Details of the state of her womb revealed that the foetus was extremely dismembered. A postmortem was done on the body at Umash Funeral Home, Nairobi. It was led by Dr Peter Ndegwa and witnessed by a number of doctors representing the family, the Dandora Community Social Justice Centre and Haki Africa. However, Caroline's family and colleagues rejected the theory as they believe she was killed because of her work that involved documenting police extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances and other forms of police brutality. Also read: “Although the cause of death is clear, the doctors were also clear that from the autopsy, it is not possible to tell who caused the damage, why or how,” said Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid. He said authorities should now establish beyond reasonable doubt what could have led to the ruptured uterus. “This being such a high profile case, it is befitting of an inquest involving all key stakeholders to confirm the circumstances that led to the death of comrade Caroline Mwatha,” said Khalid in a statement on Friday. Mwatha was reported missing on February 6 and her body was found at City Mortuary in Nairobi six days later. Her death left human rights activists in shock. The rights defenders said they need more protection, saying their work exposes them to many dangers.

He pleaded with the nurses to report to duty on Monday adding that the union officials should adopt a reconciliatory approach to the issue. Read: Meanwhile, COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli faulted Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya for ordering nurses to go back to work. Atwoli argued that Oparanya should have consulted him on the workers’ issues instead of displaying ignorance on national television. He argued that the Council of Governors signed Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs) with the nurses and they need to honour the same. “If you realise that you do not have money and you owe someone, just go back to them and explain to the modalities of payment even if it means paying in instalments,” he said. Atwoli further blamed Oparanya and Labour CS Ukur Yattani for misleading President Uhuru Kenyatta to believe that the nurses’ strike was illegal. “They left Uhuru to read a speech on petty issues,” he said. Atwoli said the President meant well for the country and should not be made to carry out tasks meant for shop stewards.

145,True,True,0.0,BONIFACE MWANGI,22 February 2019 - 09:00,,"BONIFACE MWANGI: Mwatha was murdered, police hit squad 'Hessy' celebrated death",,"Caroline Mwatha was murdered. Police have presented their version of what transpired and identified the murder suspects, yet many questions still beg for an answer. We don’t know how she ended up in the clinic. Did she walk there by herself? Was she threatened, or coerced to go to that clinic? To date, her phone is still missing. A human rights defender, Caroline Mwatha, spoke for the voiceless. The very ones on the receiving end of police violations. As a founding member of Dandora Social Justice, she defended the rights of young people who were subjected to constant police harassment, arbitrary arrests, extortion, trumped-up charges and even extra-judicial killings. It is not lost on us that the people who celebrated Caroline’s death are the police hit squad, nicknamed “Hessy”. Hessy isn’t an individual, but a bunch of sadistic police officers who routinely execute suspects in Eastlands every other day. After Caroline’s body was found, they did a long post on Facebook. In October 2018, Kenya Police executed 11 people in Dandora and in November, more young people were shot dead. Since December, however, not a single person has been executed by police in Dandora. This is no miracle. It’s as a direct result of Caroline Mwatha’s, and the Dandora Social Justice Team’s, tireless unselfish efforts in exposing extra-judicial killings. When Jacob Juma was murdered in May of 2016, police said he was last seen with a woman. When IEBC official Chris Msando was assassinated in July 2017, they killed the young woman he was allegedly last seen with, in a bid to malign his reputation. Her name was Carol Ngumbu. She was barely 21. Kenya is a very pretentious country. The moment an ordinary person is seen with someone they’re not married to, or found to have committed an error of judgment, we are so quick to believe whatever lies the police or politicians feed us. But if you’re rich and influential, politicians will host you, churches will roll out the red carpet for you to speak from the pulpit and media will extol your virtues as though you were a saint. We know of politicians who beat their wives, have sired children in every village, steal, rape and kill, yet they will never be executed in cold blood by the police, nor will the police ever share contents of their text messages with the public. The police didn’t give us Mutula Kilonzo’s sordid sexual history when he died in his Maanzoni ranch. I haven’t seen the same effort being used to discredit Caroline Mwatha, applied in corruption cases. It’s only used in murder cover-ups, like Msando’s and Juma’s. When Sharon Otieno was allegedly killed by Governor Okoth Obado her past sexual relations were brought up. In matters abortion, most private hospitals in Kenya offer walk-in abortions but more than 2,600 poor women and girls die every year due to unsafe abortions – a staggering seven lives per day. It’s the poor who die for things the rich access easily every day. If someone dies in your house, or car, the mortuary cannot receive the body without a police occurrence book (OB) report. I once picked a hit-and-run victim and rushed him to the hospital. Unfortunately, he died on the way. I was forced to go to the police to report his death and get an OB number, before the mortuary would accept his body. This we know for sure, Caroline did not kill herself. She was murdered. Her killers checked her body into the City Mortuary, like one would a library book. How callous? When did life become so cheap? Why were they allowed to book the body without an OB number? Robert Ouko was murdered, but the police claimed he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, pouring petrol on his body and setting himself on fire. Mysteriously, anyone who was involved in the Ouko case died shortly thereafter. A parliamentary report prepared in 2005 stated that former Foreign Affairs Minister Robert Ouko was killed at State House, Nakuru. It further reported that he was murdered in cold blood, his body mutilated in the presence of Nicholas Biwott and President Daniel arap Moi. His body was then dumped near his Koru home. When outspoken government critic, Father Kaiser, was found dead on that cold August morning in 2000, it was reported that police claimed he was shot in a ""gangland style execution."" The story would later change when the Kenya Police and FBI colluded to concoct a story claiming that the Catholic priest committed suicide. They claimed that he shot himself in the head with a shotgun and walked to an Acacia tree where he lay down his own body. The United States Congress passed a joint resolution calling Fr. Kaiser's death ""an ssassination"", but the rapist, warmonger, who orchestrated his murder, became our ambassador to China and went on to run for governor. Kenyan activists have a running joke, if we are killed, who among our friends will be used as collateral? Kenyan activists, at any given time, must tell a comrade(s) where they are. We don’t fake disappearance. We don’t cry wolf. A comrade, a friend, a relative must know where you are and with whom. It helps for easier tracking in the event that you suddenly go missing. When Caroline’s disappearance was reported, the police went silent only to later release a ""very comprehensive” statement about the events leading to her death. This can only imply the police were on her trail, they knew her body was lying on a cold slab in a morgue, but they waited for the body to be discovered in order for them to release that statement. Here’s a message for the Director of Criminal Investigations, George Kinoti, whom I consider an acquaintance, “In this case, you made grave mistakes. You allowed Caroline Mwatha’s body, her medical history and her pregnancy to be used against her.” I don’t know the exact circumstances of Caroline’s death, but I am certain she was murdered. Today, I shall go to Uhuru Park to celebrate her life. Her memorial service will be held at Freedom Corner, Uhuru Park, from 3pm. I shall not stand on the sidelines and watch helplessly for a one-page police press statement to be used to define Caroline Mwatha, a human being, a human rights defender, a lover, daughter, sister, wife. Her death took minutes, maybe hours, but she lived 38 full years, she loved, she fought fearlessly, and she exited this stage we call life as a hero. Go forth comrade. Rest in Power. The struggle continues….",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-02-22-boniface-mwangi-mwatha-was-murdered-police-hit-squad-hessy-celebrated-death/

Two records at the facility bear details of Carol Mbeki, the name assigned to Mwatha’s body. According to one of the records seen by the Star, Mbeki was taken to the facility on February 6 at 4.42pm by Grace Ramoya. Mbeki’s age is listed as 27, 10 years younger than Mwatha. The cause of her death, according to one of the records, is indicated as diarrhea, contrary to the official police narrative and postmortem finding that she died of excessive bleeding. There had been an abortion under unclear circumstances but it was not known if Mwatha sought it or whether she was murdered. The date, 6, appears to have been written over an initial date 7. The second record was shown to human rights officials when the body was discovered. It showed the body was taken to the mortuary at 4.42am on February 7, by Grace Ramoya. The activist, who fought police extrajudical killings in Dandora, is being buried today at Asembo Bay, Rarieda constituency. Wilfred Olal said the conflicting dates “directly impeach the credibility of the abortion theory”. He is the coordinator of the Dandora Community Justice Centre where Mwatha worked. Hussein Khalid, Haki Africa executive director, told the Star the conflicting records strengthen their rejection of the abortion theory. “We have maintained that while the autopsy result showed an attempted abortion, we know the state can do anything to cover their steps. We believe our comrade was murdered,” he said. Khalid had earlier called for “an independent, thorough, and expedient inquest” to unearth the circumstances that led to her death. A memorial service was held for the mother of two on Thursday at Uhuru Park’s freedom corner. It was attended by human rights figures, alonside the family and politicians. It emerged the Catholic Church refused to conduct a Requiem Mass “for [Mwatha] having sought to procure an abortion”. Speaking at the service, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Willy Mutunga said he rejected the police narrative about an abortion. “Cops never say the truth,” he said. “Even if police tell you the truth by accident, don’t believe it,” Mutunga said. “It’s clear the activist was murdered for her stand for the truth.” Former Justice minister Martha Karua said it is possible the activist “was killed and the obvious action taken by the killer was to scandalise her” and ruin her reputation.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-02-23-two-records-of-mwatha-confuse-abortion-theory/
147,True,True,4.0,EMMANUEL WANJALA @ItsWanjala,26 February 2019 - 18:00,,Health ministry approves post abortion care guidelines,,"The ministry of health has approved post abortion guidelines, a pocket guide for healthcare providers on how to handle complications resulting from abortions. The purpose of the book is to equip service providers with the necessary knowledge and skills on the prevention of post-abortion deaths. ""It will act as a reference for the many service providers who would wish to provide the much needed PAC services but lack or are limited in knowledge and skills,"" Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko notes in the book's prologue. The approval now paves way for PAC training to be carried out in public health facilities. The PAC guidebook complements the already existing PAC reference manual, PAC curriculum and other training packages offered by the ministry of health. ""The pocket guide should act as a quick reference at the service area and does not, in any way, promote abortion outside the law,"" Kioko said. Read; Under the law, abortion is only permitted in Kenya if the life of the mother is in danger. Article 26(4) states: ""Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is the need for emergency treatment or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law."" Article 158 stipulates a 14-year jail term to anyone who attempts to procure an abortion. Article 159 prefers three-year imprisonment to a woman who procures an abortion while Article 160 stipulates a three-year sentence for anyone who supplies drugs or instruments to procure an abortion. This evokes memories of the recent death of human rights activist Carolyne Mwatha who an autopsy report revealed that she died from excessive bleeding after a botched abortion. Doctors said the skull of her five-month unborn son was crushed, his brain sucked out and one of his arms was missing. More: Kioko said the guidelines, which will be launched officially soon, were developed following wide consultations between the ministry's Reproductive and Maternal Health Services Unit and experts. ""It is envisioned that the use of this pocket guide will contribute to the universal health coverage and by extension Vision 2030 through improvement of maternal and newborn health in Kenya,"" said Kioko.

At 19 years old,in her freshman year,with all the excitement of being in campus,hers was short-lived. “I got pregnant when I was in my freshman year, so embarrassing I guess. What was I going to tell my parents who had believed in me and had known me to be a good girl,” narrates Tecla Mwango who got pregnant at 19. We have all come across young mothers in our surrounding. Young women who were blessed with their bundles of joy way too early than expected. I am surrounded by young mothers between the age of 18 to mid-twenties. How did they nurture themselves into becoming parents in just nine months with all the unpreparedness? Are they treated differently by the society because they did not follow societal expectations? Education, marriage then children. That’s what the society expects of their children. However,some of them broke the societal norms by becoming mothers at a young age. At the beginning “In November 2015,I started falling sick thinking it was malaria or typhoid,only to realise that I was pregnant in December.I had a very tough time because I used to have an uncontrollable sleep.My mum used to talk about girls who get pregnant and abort,saying she wouldn’t recommend it.My main question was why her main topic in the house was pregnancy. This went on for days.”she says. Most young girls are always naive when they fall pregnant. With most being enticed by small things only to be left as single parents. News breaking Tecla says she did not want to break the news to her parents until they paid her rent and my school fees.She had fear that they would discontinue her education after learning of her pregnancy.So she decided to break the news through her aunt,who also advised her not to have an abortion.What to do?”Being the first born,I had broken my parents hearts through shame and unluckily,they disowned me. I suffered so much because the father to my baby had also denied me and asked me to abort it but I didn’t so he left us,”she says. Some girls find it difficult to tell their parents or guardians of their pregnancy.They then resort to abortion or running away from home. How to cope “I work while studying so that I can give my daughter the pleasant things life has to offer.Being away from her is the worst experience that I wouldn’t wish for any mother.I keep thinking of her 24/7.However,I get to go home every month to see my baby.” It is hard to balance parenting and school,which is why some girls drop out of school because of early pregnancy. Her family took her back after sometime.She then successfully gave birth to a baby girl.Her family volunteered to take the baby when she was four months old.She does part time jobs and also bakes cakes to be able to add on what her parents provide for her baby. Challenges faced “My friends talked ill of me,I lost some of them and that was very heart breaking.Being a single parent is one of the biggest challenge that most young parents go through,”Tecla explains. She says she is getting used to it everyday and is grateful to her family for finally accepting her daughter as their own.She also has supportive friends despite some of them. One has to put the child’s needs before their own which could sometimes be exhausting especially if you are your own support system. To the future moms Pregnancy at an early age is not a good thing but if you happen to be in such a position,accept it and prepare to be the best parent that you can be.Having a supportive family is the best armour. “I would advise fellow young girls who are still in school to focus on their studies first and let the rest follow.Parents should also support their children despite feeling disappointed because most of them fall into phases of depression after rejection,”she says.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-03-13-young-and-parenting/

They spoke of the agony they have gone through as the goons have kept them off the land they claim to have legitimately acquired. The investors said their land was invaded, structures and fences pulled down, the parcels subdivided and new beacons erected by hooligans calling themselves squatters. They recounted how they have been barred from accessing their property especially in Kamulu, Dramvell, Mlolongo Phase 3 and Mulinge Settlement Scheme. An elderly couple pleaded with the task force to help them get back their two-acre parcel that has been encroached on in Kamulu. Amina Kasinga and her husband said they have been evicted from the land they bought in 2012 at Sh2.5 million using bank loans when both were in formal employment. They have since retired. “We are unable to access our own land. People have invaded it in the name of squatters and erected ramshackle structures. We stopped visiting the land after 15 goons surrounded us when we went to survey the land in the company of an investment partner in 2017. We fled since it was a matter of life and death,” she said. Kasinga said together with a foreign developer from Turkey, the couple intended to build a low-cost housing project. Their land has since been subdivided into 51 parcels. She said the aborted project was meant for low income earners, especially young couples, to own two-bedroomed houses for Sh750,000. “We plead with you to take our plea to the people who can help us clear the invaders from our own land so that we realise our dream of having young people own homes at affordable prices,” she added. Kasinga said the stress has ruined her health. “We have gone through the same situation. Goons - some of who have been charged with murder - have kept us off our legitimate parcels of land. They are well known. They are big cartels,” Raphael Nzioka said. The complainants said the cartels have used fake surveyors to erect beacons on their parcels.

Today one is studying mathematics in college, another is taking a pharmacy course. Shy at first, Sarafina, 20, vividly recounts losing her mother, getting pregnant as a teenager, miscarrying and surviving the cut. She joined the Samburu Girls Foundation in 2013 after completing her primary education. Her mother died in 2003 when she was five. ""No one offered to help me get into primary school. I used to go to the schools myself and talk to headteachers to enrol me,"" she said. She was speaking on Friday at Nairobi's Fairmont Hotel during a forum on problems faced by girls. ""I have studied in almost all schools in Samburu because I do not have a permanent home,"" she Sarafina said. She would move from one relative to another but never felt welcome. ""Because no one cared about me or advised me, I fell for a man who told me that he loved me,"" she recounted. She was just 14 when she got pregnant, later losing the baby three days before her final primary education examinations. ""My relatives said all sorts of things about me and this made the trauma worse after I had lost my mother,"" she said. They also accused her of trying to abort the child. Sarafina stayed at the hospital for three days and did not receive any counselling to help her cope. ""I remember the nurse handing the dead foetus to me and sarcastically asking me to hold it,"" she wept. Sarafina said her father and stepmother forced her to undergo FGM. ""They arranged for me to undergo the cut with my younger sisters,"" she said. Despite her ordeals, Sarafina was resolute. She struggled to ensure she realised her dreams. She is enrolled at the Catholic University of East Africa pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics. Sarafina is not alone at the centre. Her friend Maria narrated how she unsuccessfully sought refuge at her aunt's home to escape the cut and early marriage. Maria's parents had resolved to marry her off immediately after her primary education. ""My mother was against early marriage but had no problem with the cut,"" she said. ""But my uncle, who was a bit learned, rescued me on the morning of the cut and took me to the centre."" Maria, who is the first born, said he has since rescued five girls from the cut and being married off early. She did her final secondary education and enrolled for a Pharmacy Course at Moi University. ""I want to go back and empower my community and family after I am done with school,"" she said. The girls told the Star that women in the Samburu community have no say and await orders from elders who cannot be opposed because it is considered a taboo. ""People in the community are afraid of curses from the elders if they go against cultural practices,"" Maria said. Joy, another woman who escaped the cut and early marriage, said she was raised by a struggling single mother. In 2011 when she was in Class 6, her uncle arranged for her marriage to an older man. ""He was 65 years old and I was going to be his third wife,"" she said. Joy, who was initially unaware of the marriage plans, said her dowry negotiations began after she arrived home for the April holidays. ""I had to undergo the cut before getting married. They had planned to send me to his home the day after the cut."" But she was rescued the next day and taken to the home where she has stayed since. The girls are appealing for more security at the centre due to threats from some parents and the men they were to marry. ""Sometimes we go to fetch firewood and some community members throw rocks at us and insult us because they say we have gone against the community,"" Joy said. The girls said, however, that their dreams supersede the cultural practices that robbed them of their childhood.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-03-23-how-samburu-girls-survived-cut-marriage-plans/

While opposing the judgement by the court of appeal that allowed gays and lesbians to register a body that will fight for their rights, Kang’ata said the verdict offends Article 1 of the Constitution that provides that sovereignty (ultimate political authority) is vested on the people. The senator said the clause should be amended to mean that all judgments, laws and decisions must be supported by the people. “For the judges to make the judgment while appreciating that Kenyans are antigay is to offend the clause,” the senator said. He added, “There is a jurisprudential debate among law students in the Social Foundations of Law unit on whether the law should follow the society or vice versa. The clause provides that the law should follow the society."" Kang’ata said even in advanced nations, such controversial debates are subjected to a referendum, giving the example of Ireland where a referendum was held on abortion and Australia on same-sex marriages. He said the church had warned that the Constitution had hidden ‘evil’ clauses that can now be seen, saying the judgment gives momentum to those pushing for a referendum to undo the clauses creating space for such rulings. He further said what was before the judges was not a question of whether homosexuality is legal and that the court considered things it should not have. “The primary issue under litigation was whether an organisation ought to be registered and if it had exhausted appellate remedies provided under the statutes before coming to court,” he added. The court of appeal on Friday ruled that humans should not be denied their fundamental rights because of how they choose to live. Three judges including Phillip Waki, Asike Makhandia and Martha Koome affirmed high court’s decision that the LGBT community has a right to freedom of association. Their decision to form an organisation, the judges said, is not criminalised by the penal code and their existence cannot be denied. But Kang’ata said the Supreme Court’s decision on Wajir gubernatorial case already settled such matters after ruling that the High Court does not have jurisdiction to handle all matters. He said a procedure that has been established by a statute needs to be respected. Judges should treat the law as it is, not as it ought to be because that makes it uncertain, he said. “If a magistrate who is pro-life is handling a charge of an offence that is punishable by death, can they recuse themselves on such grounds or proceed to declare such a clause illegal?” he posed. The senator said judges do not have the tools of telling the merits or demerits of law, ""as that is the purview of politicians and other social sciences"". He pointed out that there are serious objections to same-sex marriages which judges failed to address, including what will happen to other victimless crimes like drug usage or incest.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-03-25-kangata-objects-to-appellate-courts-verdict-allowing-lgbt-organisation/

The squatters engaged police in running battles for the better part of Saturday and Sunday morning, after they were dispersed in Mberere during a meeting to subdivide part of the farm. Police lobbed tear-gas and fired in the air to disperse the invaders, who have cultivated a huge chunk of the land. Anti-riot police officers arrested five from the aborted meeting. Squatters later converged in Soksok, where again police in three Land Cruisers dispersed them. Tinderet police boss Margaret Kola led the operation of the arrest of the 15. They are expected to be taken to court on Monday to answer to charges of trespass and malicious damage to property. Chebonet squatters chairman Hillary Cheruiyot said police used excessive force in dispersing them. He said some of those arrested were apprehended at their homes. There is an ongoing construction of a perimeter fence to secure the huge panels next to Mberere police station. Nandi leaders, led by MP Julius Meli and Governor Stephen Sang, had asked the squatters not to engage in illegal activities but to pull resources and buy the farm as it had been put for sale.

Betty Akinyi Nyanya, Michael Onyonka Onchiri, Richard Ramoya and Alexander Gitau Gikonya were yesterday arraigned before the High Court in Nairobi and charged with murdering Mwatha and her unborn baby. Appearing before Justice Jessie Lesiit, the four pleaded not guilty. Defence lawyers made an application to have them released on bail but the prosecution opposed it saying it will be in public interest to detain them. Justice Lesiit will make a ruling on April 18. The judge directed that Michael Onchiri be taken to hospital for treatment after his lawyer told the court he suffered injuries from an assault. The four were required to plead to the charges on March 4 but failed as three of them did not have a lawyer. The suspects had also not been taken for mental tests to establish whether they are fit to stand trial. On February 12, detectives arrested six people in connection with the death of the Dandora-based activist. However, only four were charged and the other two will be state witnesses. Earlier, the court had granted the prosecution’s application to detain all the six suspects for 14 days pending investigations. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga agreed with the prosecution that although they have a right to be released on bond, the six face a serious offence and releasing them might endanger their lives.

Betty Akinyi, Michael Onchiri, Dale Richard Ramoya and Alexander Gitau are charged with conspiring to murder the Dandora-based activist on February 7. They are allegedly connected with the abortion and disposal of the body. There were initially six suspects, but two were turned into state witnesses. The state argued that Akinyi has an ongoing case at Kigumo Courts where she is charged with child stealing. The prosecution cites Chief Inspector Joseph Wanjohi’s investigations and observations that if released the suspects would interfere with investigations. One suspect has already evaded arrest and the prosecution said if the other suspects are released they would work together to undermine the case. The four pleaded not guilty and were remanded into police custody. Appearing before Justice Jessie Lesiit on Wednesday, the suspects through their lawyers sought release on lenient bond terms. Akinyi and her son Ramoya argued that they have no criminal records and are committing to attend court religiously. They said they have strong family ties and were in no way a flight risk. They said they could comply with all court orders. The prosecutor said the case has aroused public interest and releasing them will subject them to hostility and possible danger. The family is not at peace owing to the manner in which mother and foetus were killed, the state said. Critics say the abortion was carried out to cover up the murder of the controversial activist who targeted police extrajudicial killings. The body was found on February 12 at City Mortuary. The bail and bond ruling will be made on May 5. Earlier, a lower court had granted the prosecution’s application to detain all the six original suspects for 14 days pending investigations.

In a petition addressed to Governor Mike Sonko, the activists from the Centre for Reproductive Health, the Federation of Women Lawyers, and the Women Link Worldwide, among others, argued that the messaging instills stigma against abortion. But Sozo Church of God, which sponsored the ads, dismissed the claims. Meantime, the activists have given the county government 14 days to act or they will sue and continue their protests. Sozo Church of God said it will not back off. One of its billboards at Westlands matatu station calls for closure of abortion clinics. Another one reads, ""Abortion is murder."" The billboards are strategically located along city roads, including Nyeri Road, Oloitoktok Road, Ngong Road, Dennis Pritt Road, Waiyaki Way and University Way. The pro-choice crusaders argue that calling for a shutdown of the clinics that provide reproductive services, including abortion, amounts to rooting for violation of the right to access to professional and accessible healthcare. “The Constitution allows abortion services to be made available to women with life-threatening conditions, which can only be rectified through the procedures,” Martin Onyango said. He is a senior legal officer at the Centre for Reproductive Health. “By calling for shutting down of the licensed outlets that perform this procedure, what are the sponsored of this messaging saying? They want the women of this country to resort to nondescript abortion outlets that finish their lives?” Onyango said women in slums and poor neighbourhoods put their lives at risk because of limited reproductive health options available to them. “Rich women in Runda, Lavington, Karen and other places check in at high-end hospitals and procure an abortion at will with much ease and no one asks them. Poor women are forced to go to quacks and die there. This we cannot allow,” he said. But the head of Sozo Church of God, Apostle Kathy Kageni-Oganga, defended the billboards. She told the Star her outfit is “within our constitutional rights to put up such messaging because abortion is illegal in the country”. “There is no law that allows abortion in the country, except for cases of medical emergency. Our Constitution is clear that life begins at conception. So any procedure that terminates that young life is murderous,” she said. The pro-choice lobbies argue that women who find themselves in situations such as conception by way of rape or unplanned pregnancy should be given the right to seek abortion services. Oganga, however, said her church has put contacts for alternative reproductive health options for such cases — but not abortion. “We've put up arrangements to accommodate women in such situations, including counselling and support. Abortion is never the right option because life is sacrosanct,” she said. ""I have four children and can have many more. I’m a rape victim myself and this is not a ticket to kill at will. We're not calling women murderous. The act of abortion is the murder here.” (Edited by F'Orieny)",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-04-25-lobbies-give-sonko-14-days-to-pull-down-anti-abortion-billboards-but-sponsoring-church-defiant/

Akoth, who got pregnant at 13, said Kenya is not well prepared to deal with the consequences of lowering the sex consent age. During an interview with the Star, the project manager at Girls Advocacy Alliance said there were no laws to protect her as a minor. ""I was at the mercy of the community which viewed me as a woman because I had a child, "" she said. ""I remember once during a committee meeting, some community members wanted me to join tailoring school so I could take care of my child because they said I was a mother."" However, Akoth's mother refused and insisted that she needed to finish her education. Akoth said it is important to ask for the views of children so that their voice is heard. She strongly condemned lowering the consent age stating that it would be a violation of the same laws put in place to protect children. Nelson Makanda supported Akoth. He said lowering the age of consent means fewer girls will not be able to attend high school due to early pregnancies. He also said abortions will be on the rise among teenage girls due to stigma associated with pregnancy. Makanda, a representative of the Inter-religious Council of Kenya encouraged teachers to go outside the traditional modes of teaching and impart life skills to students.

""We must not fall into the trap of throwing stones and not providing solutions. We must task ourselves with realistic targets to come up with an alternative curriculum,"" said reverend Tom Otieno. He spoke in Nairobi yesterday at the Kenya Christian Professionals forum on the advancement on the of the LGBTQ agenda, sexual revolution, comprehensive sex education and legalisation of abortion on demand. Otieno said with proper information, the church and parents are able to handle comprehensive sex education without the kind of parameters given in the current curriculum. He faulted the curriculum, stating the church's fear comes from introducing sex information to children without causing them to have an unseen negative interest in sex. He stated that the Bible has given guidance on what should and should not be taught regarding sex. Dr Wahome Ngare, a gyneacologist and obstetrician, said the curriculum teaches that sexuality is extra-marital contrary to the Christian values of sex. ""We do not get married to have sex. We get married to have children and sex becomes a necessary component,"" he said. ""Children will be taught how to enjoy sex and to experiment from the age of ten and since pregnancy is considered a bad side effect of sex, adolescents are offered contraceptives and safe abortion options.""

""The part of the brain that controls our reasoning, matures between 22 and 24 years,"" he said. Otieno warned that education cannot be used to legitimize what is not right and comprehensive sex education is being used to market sexual revolution globally.

Amina, (not her real name) revealed to the Star during an interview on Wednesday that she has continually been defiled by her grandfather over the last four years. She revealed that he would thank her after he was done with the gruesome act and lure her with money- Sh 1000 in exchange for her silence. “I was told by my relatives if I terminate my pregnancy, I will die. So I will keep it,” she said. The accused, Suleiman Hussein was arrested in his one-bedroom Kibera residence on Tuesday night and taken to Kilimani Police Station. On Friday, the Muslim cleric was charged before Kibera senior resident Esther Boke. He was also charged with another count of indecently touching the private parts of the minor. The court declined the accused's request to be released on bond, saying he could tamper with evidence since he is an influential figure. The magistrate ordered Suleiman to be detained at Industrial Area Prison pending his bond application on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Nairobi women’s hospital confirmed that she is three months pregnant. The report also showed that she suffered bruises on her private parts, an indication of frequent and violent defilement. It all started in 2016 when she was in class one and her grandfather would defile her on his matrimonial bed when his wife was away on business. She softly said that her grandmother never cared whatsoever what was happening in their household. When she got pregnant for the first time in May last year, her grandmother facilitated a successful abortion for her. Amina says Hussein would threaten her with violence when she reported her ordeal to her grandmother. She told the Star that she had no knowledge that she was expectant until she saw blood oozing from her private parts. “When he told her what he has done, he would threaten me that he would call out on people from the community to beat me up,” she told the star. Amina bravely used to go to her neighbours whom she trusted and narrated what happens behind closed doors. “Whenever he used to go to the mosque, I would rush to my neighbours' homes and tell them what happens. I was shocked to learn that I am not the only one he defiles. People from the community started to learn about his actions,” she said. The grandfather transferred her to two different schools in Nairobi after the rumours started circulating. In 2017, the Nubian Rights Forum (NRF) began to investigate the matter back when she was in her previous school after receiving information from a neighbour. Her family reportedly knew about the nasty incidence and did not want any action taken. The class six teenager was lastly defiled on May 18 after Hussein prepared her stepbrother for the mosque. Hussein is married to two wives. Officers attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at Kilimani Police Station have liaised with the Child Protection Unit (CPU), a formation still domiciled under DCI’s office to conduct investigations. In a statement exclusively issued by the Star on Wednesday, Kilimani OCPD Micheal Muchiri said that all due diligence and investigations are complete.

This was the experience of Diana Achieng and Janiffer Vaati living in Kibra, Nairobi. They attended different schools but both were lucky to have never missed school while on their monthly period since they had a surplus of sanitary pads, right until last year when they finished secondary school. Local and international NGOs flock schools within Kibra to donate sanitary products to girls above the age 12 to reduce and, hopefully, eliminate the number of girls missing school due to lack of sanitary pads. A harsh reality is that girls who do not attend school due to lack of school fees can not access these free products, which are distributed to schools by the government as well. Without sanitary pads, these girls opt to use old pieces of cloth. In the teenage years, young women should be keen on learning about proper menstrual health management, as these are the formative years of a woman’s life. How you treat your menstrual hygiene impacts your womanhood entirely. According to UNFPA, the average age of onset of menstruation (menarche) is 14, while the average age at menopause is 50. This means that a woman will experience menses and its effects for a minimum of 36 years. Living wage According to the 2019 Economic Survey, the informal sector’s monthly basic minimum wage in Kenya’s largest cities is Sh15,142. However, not many of those in the informal sector earn this. According to the Kenya Demographic Health Survey 2014, the average household size in Kenya is 3.9 members. After all major expenses such as food, housing, healthcare and education have been paid, the family is only left with Sh1,400 to cater for miscellaneous costs. These include clothing, household items, emergency expenses and personal care, such as menstrual health products or medicines for the mother and/or daughter(s). Many girls and women in their menses are accustomed to using disposable sanitary pads, compared to other products such as tampons, reusable (washable) pads and menstrual cups. The choice of what to use depends on personal preference and affordability. The price of sanitary pads varies from cheaper brands which cost Sh50 for a packet of eight to others which cost up to Sh100. For women who are allergic to sanitary pads material or prefer tampons, they are forced to make the choice of spending between Sh140 to Sh280 for a packet of eight. For women and girls with heavy monthly flows, the cost is double as they have to use at least two packets of pads or tampons every month. Other options include the use of menstrual cups, which range from Sh1,500 to Sh3,500. While these are cost effective - a menstrual cup can last up to to ten years - they are not as popular as their use is compounded by the added cost of having to ensure they are properly cleaned and stored until the next use. The reusable (washable) which pads cost between Sh50 and Sh100 are gaining popularity for their affordability as they can be reused for up to 12 months. However, users have to contend with the challenge of accessing clean water to ensure they wash the pads properly. Other challenges faced by women and girls include basic sanitation facilities such as toilets and appropriate disposal systems. Disposal of used pads and tampons is a major concern as it can take between 500-800 years for a commercial menstrual pad, such as Always or Kotex, to decompose because they're made from non biodegradable plastics, synthetics, and heavily treated with preservatives. Almost 90 per cent of a sanitary napkin is plastic. The thin top layer on napkins, known as the dri-weave top sheet, is made of polypropylene (a plastic polymer). The padding is mostly wood pulp mixed with super absorbent polymers and the leak-proof layer is made from an impermeable polyethylene. But it is not only menstrual health products that women and girls have to contend with every single month. For some women and girls, the onset of menses sparks off other complications which have a huge cost implication. Additional costs An additional cost incurred, mainly due to poor menstrual hygiene management , is treating diseases brought about by menses. They include yeast infections, urinary tract infections and Hepatitis B. There is the increased risk of developing cervical cancer. Women also experience discomfort related to menses such as cramps, which often times lead to them seeking medical attention. MHM includes the use of clean material to absorb or collect menstrual blood, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual material. On a Sh15,142 living wage, a reasonable allowance for healthcare needs would be Sh2,200 for the entire family. Racheal, a soft-spoken and petite 22-year-old, says that doctors mistook her cramps for abortion. She dreads the thought of periods because of the pain and discomfort she has to endure. ""On one occasion, I was in unbearable pain and when my parents took me to hospital, the doctors insisted on running tests to find out if I was aborting or in labour,"" she says. She constantly gets panic attacks during her four to five-day period and always has to be rushed to hospital when it gets worse. ""I once got a panic attack at home because of my period. I had to be rushed to hospital. Another time I was in school and my period started when we were lined up for parade,"" she says. ""It got really painful and I had to be taken to class by a first aider and when the pain got worse, I got into a panic attack and had to be rushed to Nairobi Women Hospital before my parents came for me."" The University of Nairobi student says she once started throwing up and having diarrhoea as she came from class at a local college. ""I was going home from Zetech and my periods started. I alighted from the matatu I was in and went to a nearby hotel because I was feeling ill,"" she said. ""The hotel manager took me to a chemist and called my mother and auntie to come pick me up."" She has resorted to walking around with Ponstan which she has been prescribed to deal with menstrual pain and to prevent migraines associated with menstruation. She has to take the medication whenever her periods are about to start. ""I try to go out less because of the bad experiences I have. I also sweat heavily and struggle with stomach upset as well as body weakness. I hate periods!"" she says. On average, Rachel spends Sh300 for her menstrual health products per month and an additional Sh600 for the medicine she needs to manage her health during this time. Janice, a high school graduate from Samburu county, states that she did not know she was having her period the first time it happened. The 19-year-old states that it began with really bad cramps when she was 14. ""I fainted because of cramps and I could not eat foods that had sugar because those made me feel nauseated,"" she says. However, her flow did not begin immediately and she only noticed a few spots when she got home. ""I was prescribed Buscopan to ease the pain of the cramps because I could not do anything at all,"" she says. Other symptoms Janice has include breast sensitivity, body aches and mood swings. She has cravings for cold foods and her flow lasts four days. ""My signs start showing about three days before and that involves cramping until a day into my period. It's the worst,"" she says. On average, Janice spends Sh500 per month on the medicines and an average Sh800 for her sanitary products. Government promises According to the Basic Education Amendment Bill (2017), the government should provide free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels to every girl registered and enrolled in a public basic education institution and has reached puberty. In the financial year 2018/19, Treasury allocated Sh460 million toward the National Free Sanitary Towel Distribution Programme, which will cater for 3.7 million girls in public primary schools, special primary and secondary schools in the country. Even with this programme in progress, still girls in rural areas and urban slums miss school since they can’t afford sanitary products. With the help of non-governmental organisations, the number has significantly reduced over the past couple of years. It is estimated that one in 10 girls in Africa is absent from school during their menses. Everlyne Bowa, the founder of Agape Woman and Child Empowerment Foundation, has been manufacturing reusable pads for the first three months after observing that sanitary products are not readily affordable to everyone, especially in the slum areas, and this leads to young girls engaging in risky behaviour just to get them, such as transactional sex. She distributes to five informal schools and sells to community members at Sh50. When the prices of materials for production are hiked, Bowa feels the pinch, yet she chooses to produce more and provide employment to local youths. “Distribution of sanitary pads should be done equally to all schools and not just government schools”, Bowa says. She further urges the government to form subcounty distribution channels for the pads and standardize prices. More women are choosing to wear washable pads, not just for the affordability, but also because they contribute to environmental conservation. Way forward Sanitary products are a basic need in any household that has women and adolescent girls. Therefore, employers should evaluate the whole economic situation and offer better wages in order for families to meet these needs. Ironically, condoms, which are not a necessity, are issued freely at public institutions and hospitals, yet sanitary towels are issued at a cost. This goes to show that menstrual health management is just an afterthought, and until it is taken seriously by the government and its partners, girls will keep missing school and the healthcare needs will keep going up. Life after secondary school education means that Diana and Janiffer have to purchase sanitary products for themselves. Luckily, their guardians can afford to buy them. But it breaks their hearts seeing their neighbours and peers lack, yet they can’t provide for them. They have taken it upon themselves to offer lessons on menstrual hygiene to young girls, and urge them to speak freely about their menstrual experiences with their parents and peers.

The law could prohibit abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. State legislators overwhelmingly backed the bill on Wednesday, by 79 votes to 23 and Governor John Bel Edwards signed the bill into law on Thursday. It is the latest in a raft of anti-abortion measures which are expected to face legal challenges. Media captionDina had to give birth to her rapist's child - under Alabama's abortion ban women would have no choice. Four other states have passed similar limits to abortion this year. In a statement, Governor Edwards said: ""I call on the overwhelming bipartisan majority of legislators who voted for [the law] to join me in continuing to build a better Louisiana that cares for the least among us and provides more opportunity for everyone."" He did not hold a signing ceremony. Governor Edwards has long opposed abortion. Support for abortion restrictions has put some state Democrats at odds with the national party, which views access to the procedure as a core plank of its platform. Women throughout the US have staged protests against the Lousiana legislation, and major Hollywood stars and production companies have vowed to boycott states that implement such bans. Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have all publicly threatened to rethink production in these states if the laws take effect. What are heartbeat laws? So-called heartbeat laws seek to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetal heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. Although Louisiana's stringent law does allow abortions in cases where the pregnant woman's life is in danger, it does not include exemptions for pregnancies resulting from incest or rape. But the law will only come into force if a federal court upholds a similar ban passed in neighbouring Mississippi. A judge temporarily blocked the Mississippi law when it was passed. US President Donald Trump has appointed two conservative judges to the Supreme Court since taking office, and analysts say conservatives across the US see this as the moment to challenge the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling - which granted women the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Which states have passed restrictions? Louisiana is the fifth state to pass a heartbeat law, after Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Mississippi. The US Supreme Court earlier this year narrowly blocked new abortion restrictions in Louisiana, which would have required doctors who provide abortion services to be certified to practise at a nearby hospital - which critics say would have limited the right to abortion and would cause two of the state's abortion clinics to close. US President Donald Trump has said he is against abortion except where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life, or results from rape or incest.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-05-31-louisiana-passes-law-banning-abortions-after-heartbeat-is-detected/

Judges Aggrey Muchelule, John Mativo, Lydia Achode, George Odunga and Mumbi Ngugi asserted that the Constitution allows a window for abortion. Article 26 (4) of the Constitution states that, ‘abortion is permitted in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is a need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law’. Odunga said the Maputo Protocol which Kenya is a signatory, allows abortion for girls and women who get pregnant as a result of sexual violence. He ruled that the director of medical services violated the law by withdrawing the 2012 Standards and guidelines and training curriculum for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion in Kenya. “The guidelines were public policy documents that were passed through a process that involves public participation. The withdrawal should have followed the same procedure,” Ngugi. She added; ""It’s not the cause of pregnancy but effect of it that determines whether abortion is permitted. If a trained health practitioner finds that a pregnancy from rape or incest interferes with the mental, social or physical well-being of woman, abortion is allowed."" The judges have also ordered that JMM’s mother is entitled to comprehensive reparation due to inefficiencies of the hospitals where she was treated. JMM’s case is the ground on which the petition was built. She got pregnant after sexual violence and tried to procure an abortion from a quack doctor. The process went wrong and she bled excessively damaging her kidneys. She was taken to three different government hospitals seeking post-abortion care before she died. Her compensation of Sh3 million is to be paid by the state. More:",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-06-12-court-declines-to-declare-abortion-totally-illegal/

The call comes after the High Court on Wednesday ruled that the Director of Medical Services and the Ministry of Health had violated the law by withdrawing the 2012 Standards and Guidelines for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion in Kenya and banning the training of health professionals on abortion. They have called for the immediate reinstatement of training for all nurses, clinical officers, midwives and doctors on the provision of safe and legal abortion services. Further, the organisations want all facilities to have trained health professionals, essential medicines and equipment and the dissemination of information on safe and legal abortion. Speaking during a joint press conference in Nairobi on Thursday, the lobby groups said the ruling is a victory to women and girls especially from the lower socioeconomic status that are disproportionately affected by unsafe abortions. ""... women and girls will be able to access safe and legal abortion services and information, and health providers will be able to offer abortion and post-abortion care services without the fear of being prosecuted,"" their statement read. Christine Alai, a legal expert on sexual violence in conflict, said the court ruling affirmed women and girl's right to seek an abortion and care services at health facilities. The legal expert said that any woman who feels her mental or physical health is affected by their pregnancy has the right to walk into a health facility and request an abortion. ""It will be the obligation of that health professional to determine whether the life or physical or psychological health of the girl or women is affected by that pregnancy in order to procure an abortion,"" she said. Alai said the ruling is a landmark decision because most people believe abortion cannot be permitted under any circumstance. Abortion in Kenya is allowed if in the opinion of a trained health professional there is a need for emergency treatment or if the life or health of the mother is in danger or if permitted by any other written law. Martin Onyango, a lawyer at the Centre for Reproductive Health, said the absence of abortion services in clinics forces a lot of women and girls to seek help from quacks because trained providers fear arrest. ""Women and girls seek unsafe clandestine abortions due to lack of access to reproductive health information and quality services, lack of clarity on the legal status of abortion and pervasive cultural stigma,"" he said. According to the lobby groups, unsafe abortion is one of the main causes of maternal deaths in Kenya. They argue that though these deaths are preventable. Seven women and girls die from unsafe abortions every day. They termed the ruling a step in the right direction toward improving maternal health and gender equality in the country.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-06-14-lobbies-want-abortion-in-all-health-facilities/
168,True,False,0.0,KAZUNGU KATANA,16 June 2019 - 07:01,FOREIGN INFLUENCE,Can US Embassy help tame rising corruption tide under Ambassador McCarter,"• Mcarter, the 17th US ambassador to Kenya, has arrived at a time the country is battling corruption and terrorism. • Twitter is Mcarter’s principle tool of communicating with Kenyans, and he recently sent tweets condemning graft in Kenya.","On February 5, US Ambassador Kyle Mcarter told a group of Kenyans at a church service and dinner in St Louis, Missouri, that President Donald Trump’s priorities in Kenya would be to support the fight against corruption and terrorism. In retrospect, US-Kenya relations have had a checkered history. During the Cold War, Kenya aligned itself fully with the US and the West in the campaign against communism. Eight US ambassadors served in Kenya during this period. The first US envoy William Attwood (1964-66), had a short tour of duty, as he was expelled after criticising President Jomo Kenyatta’s government in his book, The Blacks and the Reds, which remains banned in Kenya. Others were ambassadors Glenn Ferguson (1966-69), Robinson Mcllvaine (1969-73), Anthony Marshall (1974-77), Wilbert Le Melle (1977-80), William Harrop (1980-83), Gerald Thomas (1983-86), and Elinor Constable (1986-89). The American diplomats who have served in Kenya in the post-Cold War era are Smith Hempstone (1989-93), Aurelia Brazeal (1993-96), Prudence Bushnell (1996-99), Johnnie Carson (1999-03), William Bellamy (2003-06), Michael Ranneberger (2006-11), Jonathan Scott Gration (2011-12), Robert Godec (2012-19), and now McCarter. Each of these ambassadors has served at different terms in Kenya’s history and they have had varied impacts. Gration, for example, has served the shortest period, while Bushnell is remembered for her valiant handling of the 1998 Nairobi US Embassy bombing. Carson is credited for the diplomatic push to persuade President Daniel Moi to step down after serving his two terms post-multiparty politics; Ranneberger is remembered for pushing the generational change youth agenda through President Barack Obama’s ‘Yes, Youth can’ programme that nearly caused his recall through an aborted impeachment motion in the National Assembly. But it is Hempstone’s ‘undiplomatic’ approach over multiparty politics that drew the ire of President Moi and his Kanu regime. Hearrived in Kenya on December 7, 1989 at a time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, marking the end of communism and the dismantling of single-party regimes elsewhere. Whereas the Third Wave of Democratisation was sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa, Kanu had resisted political change. Hempstone dared Moi to open the political space and to release political detainees. In a speech at a function at the Nairobi Rotary Club in May 1990, the envoy declared that the US would provide aid to countries that nourished democratic institutions, defended human rights and practiced multi-party politics. For daring to take a stand against Moi, he was Kanu’s number one enemy. At one time, the Foreign Affairs minister Ndolo Ayah branded Hempstone a slave master! But Hempstone wasn’t the man to budge. Initially alone in the multiparty crusade, he managed to persuade other Western ambassadors in Nairobi, notably those from the Nordic countries and Germany, to join him. Prof Michael Chege has noted that Hempstone became a Kenyan folk hero, celebrated in song and poetry. More than any other US ambassador in Africa, Hempstone spoke freely against dictatorship and in favour of civil liberties. Mcarter, the 17th US ambassador to Kenya, has arrived at a time the country is battling corruption and terrorism. Whereas there is not a doubt that US-Kenya collaboration in combatting terrorism is a huge success, corruption remains elusive: It still has to adequately receive policy attention in Washington. Mcarter is increasingly becoming visible among ordinary Kenyans, especially on the war against corruption. He is beginning to bite. Like his boss in Washington, Twitter is his principle tool of communicating with Kenyans. His tweet some few weeks ago was satirical, cleverly couched to mock Kenyan leaders attending the Annual National Prayer Breakfast in Nairobi. He urged the leaders to walk the talk on the war on corruption. The ambassador recently followed up with another tweet in Kiswahili, with a touch of Sheng slang, urging Kenyans to reject corrupt in society. He wondered how Kenyans would welcome corrupt people in their midst as heroes and heroines, while petty thieves earned huge punishments, including jail terms. Mcarter’s mounting voice against corruption seems to enjoy the support of other major Western embassies in Nairobi, notably the British, the Nordic states, Germany and Canada. These countries have in the past voiced their concerns about corruption in Kenya. It should be recalled that the combined onslaught of these countries alongside the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the 1990s, enabled the local pro-democracy movement to compel the Kanu regime to re-introduce plural politics in 1991. The challenge now is whether this time round, the US and the other Western embassies in Nairobi are ready and willing to apply their combined onslaughts to tame the rising tide of corruption. One option these countries have, and which has been used in the past, is to deny travel visas to graft suspects. However, this option has had little impact because the names of such suspects have not been made public, in part because of visa regulations. But exceptions could be made, especially to high-ranking officials, if only to shame them and to serve as examples to others. The other option that has also been used in the past with minimal success is the seizure of property and finances illegally acquired and stashed in some of these countries. It is now time for this move to be expedited and those found culpable to be similarly exposed to the public. The third option is for the US and the West to use the carrot and stick. If diplomatic collaboration fails and push should come to shove, they could exert non-diplomatic measures, including denial of development and aid funds to institutions that frustrate anti-corruption measures. These measures produced the desired results in the form of plural politics in 1991 and there is no reason why these same measures — along with domestic support — should not produce the desired results in the form taming corruption today.

But the management of the world famous park has dismissed the claims noting that guides are still working and had not been replaced. A meeting called between KWS and the community that lives around Maasai Cultural Centre to resolve the issue aborted in the last minute due to the differences. Community leader Jackson Sencho said some of the tour guides had worked in the park for over 20 years and had vast experience. Sencho said the guides who hail from the community had been informed that their services were no longer needed, sparking fear and anxiety. “KWS has had an agreement to allow trained tour guides from the community to work in the park but we do not know why this is changing,” he said. He added that a promise by KWS to construct a dispensary for residents had failed to materialize forcing them to trek for long distances in search of medical assistance. “Currently, we have a problem with KWS over employment opportunities, boundary dispute and lack of support to the communities around the park,” he said. But speaking on phone, the park warden Peter Lekeren dismissed the allegations saying they were working closely with members of the community. Lekeren said that no guide had been kicked from the park, adding that all were on duty serving visitors. “The press is welcome to the park to certify that tour guides are working in different sections of the park,” he said.

Nicholas Moipei, who is the chairman Governing Council of the Kenya Cultural Centre, is alleged to have illegally dismissed acting chief executive officer Edwin Gichangi even after the court ordered against it. Gichangi then moved to the court seeking to commit Moipei and Benson Kimoni, who is acting CEO, to prison for disobeying the July 5, 2018, court order. “The court, after considering all the facts placed before it, comes to the conclusion that Moipei was in contempt by wilfully disobeying a valid court order he was aware of,” the court ruled. However, the court did not find Kimoni in contempt as had been claimed by Gichinga. The court further directed Moipei to appear in court for mitigation and sentencing on Monday next week. The court had ordered the Kenya Cultural Centre to unconditionally lift the Gichinga suspension from employment and further ordered for his immediate reinstatement and restoration of all assets bestowed on him by virtue of his office. Justice Stephen Radido in his verdict ruled that there was in deed an order made by the court on July 5 last year directing the centre to reinstate Gichinga pending the hearing and determination of the dispute lodged. ""It cannot be said that the order was ambiguous or not clear as it directed that the suspension of the Gichinga be lifted and he be restored to office,"" he ruled. “The assertion by Moipei that there was no order restraining the termination of the Gichinga’s employment has no factual or legal backing, considering that no fresh allegation or charges were put to him."" The court also noted that Moipei received the order because he wrote to Gichinga informing him that he had received the court order and was consequently lifting the suspension. Despite having acted on the court order, Moipei invited Gichinga to attend a disciplinary hearing on July 9 last after a previous hearing scheduled through a letter dated June 19 had aborted. Gichinga declined to attend the hearing arguing that there was a court order in force and he would not submit to the jurisdiction of the disciplinary panel when there was an order. “Despite the misgivings by Gichinga, the council met under the chairmanship of Moipei and resolved to dismiss him from employment on the same allegations,” the judge ruled. Moipei had defended their move, saying that there were new grounds for taking disciplinary action against Gichinga but the judge noted that that would have constituted or requited a fresh disciplinary process which was never done. Moipei had also argued that the order was directed to the centre and not the council members and, therefore, it was wrong for him to be cited for contempt. The judge said being chair of the council Moipei was aware of the agenda of the meeting and the court order but he did not tell the council that there was an order. “Nevertheless and in spite of having been served or being aware of the court order, Moipei went ahead to superintend over an agenda contrary to a valid court order,"" he said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-07-06-moipei-quartets-dad-faces-jail-for-contempt/
172,True,True,16.0,"Betty Odallo, Lucy Minayo and Martin Onyango",20 July 2019 - 12:00,KATIBA CORNER,Abortion where mother's health is at risk is a right,"• A very large number of patients in women’s wards in Kenyan hospitals are there because of the effects of unsafe abortion. • In Kenya, women and girls from poorer backgrounds are more vulnerable to sexual violence.","JMM was a 14-year-old schoolgirl, living in rural Kisii when sometime in 2014, she was forced to have sexual intercourse. Due to a lack of information on how to respond to the situation, or whom to approach, she was not able to receive immediate post-rape care, including emergency contraception. Two months later, JMM discovered she was pregnant. Fearing blame and rejection from her family, she confided in a friend who took her to an untrained person who performed an unsafe abortion on her. She suffered complications from the procedure, and sought post-abortion care at a local dispensary, a county referral hospital, a mission hospital, before she finally ended up at Kenyatta National Hospital. Lack of quality care and significant delays in her transfer from one facility to the next led to her developing chronic kidney illness, to which she succumbed in June last year. The World Health Organization defines unsafe abortion as a procedure for terminating pregnancies, carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards or both. The continued lack of access to safe legal abortion services causes many women and girls in Kenya to resort to illegal, unsafe abortion. A very large number of patients in women’s wards in Kenyan hospitals are there because of the effects of unsafe abortion. Sadly, the evidence, in this case, showed that even women may not get adequate care. In Kenya, women and girls from poorer backgrounds are more vulnerable to sexual violence, less able to know how to obtain an abortion (legal or not), less able to pay for it, and less able to pay for treatment, as JMM could not pay for treatment for kidney disease. LACK OF GUIDANCE An important tool for avoiding tragedies like JMM’s would be for official guidance, and training, to medical professionals on when abortion is permissible and how to carry it out. The Kenyan Ministry of Health did have such guidance and training, but in 2013 the Director of Medical Services withdrew the standards and guidelines on reducing maternal deaths and injuries from unsafe abortion. He withdrew the national training curriculum on provision of safe and legal abortion services, threatened legal and professional sanctions against anyone conducting such training, and banned the use of Medabon, a widely-used combination medicine used for medical abortions. These actions created a skills gap in the health sector in the handling of abortion and post-abortion care and created confusion amongst women, girls and health service providers on the legal status of abortion. Consequently, women and girls, including those in situations similar to that of JMM, could not access quality, timely, life-saving abortion and post-abortion care services. WHEN ABORTION IS POSSIBLE First, the court emphasised that as a general rule, medical abortion is not permissible, as the Constitution clearly states. Equally, there are some clear exceptions to this. Most important is the exception if the life or health of the mother is in danger – provided that a trained health professional assesses that this is the case. In the court’s view, health comprises not only physical but also mental and social well-being. And a pregnancy that results from rape may constitute a threat to a woman’s mental and psychological health and, therefore, qualify her to access abortion services. This clarification that rape or defilement may qualify one for abortion is critical to addressing the effects of sexual violence on women and girls. WHAT DOES 'OPINION OF A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL MEAN'? The court also explained clearly the provision that talks about “the opinion of a trained health professional,” on this matter. This is not limited to doctors or specialist obstetrician-gynaecologists only: Indeed, it includes nurses, clinical officers, and midwives. The majority of the first-line health facilities that women and girls attend to seek health services, including reproductive health services, are manned by nurses and clinical officers. The impact of this judgment is, therefore, that women and girls in rural and marginalised areas can, like their counterparts in urban areas, access life-saving services, offered by health service providers that are reachable by them. RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICERS The court was categorical that by unilaterally and arbitrarily withdrawing the standards and guidelines and the training curriculum on safe legal abortion, which had been developed through participatory processes, the DMS acted outside the scope of his powers. The court was also categorical that the actions of the DMS left a gap that meant women and girls could not access the right to abortion under the Constitution. Consequently, the court ordered the reinstatement of the guidelines. Through this decision, the court reaffirmed that public officers play an important role in the realisation of the rights enshrined in the bill of rights and that any policy or other actions that they take must be aimed at enabling access to those rights. The court did not focus on Article 26(4) (on abortion) alone but added that withdrawal of the guidelines affected the rights of women and girls to the highest attainable standard of health, to non-discrimination, to information, to consumer rights, and to benefit from scientific progress. In fact, it affected the rights of health professionals also to these rights. Nothing could bring back JMM (who died while the case was in court). The court did award compensation for violation of JMM’s constitutional rights – which would go to her mother. We praise the judges for diligently applying their minds to the plight of women and girls. As a result of the judgment, there is now indisputable clarity that a bortion, where the health of the mother is at risk, is a right, that health is not restricted to physical health, and that risk to health arising from rape or defilement is included. The court also makes it clear that to enable access to safe abortion, the government should provide accurate, complete and non-prejudicial information on when, where and how women and girls can access abortion services. By withdrawing the Guidelines that did this the Ministry had made Article 26(4) of the Constitution a dead letter. The court also made the connection between the possibility of safe abortion and achievement of goals on reduction of maternal mortality. We suggest that in addition, the government should work with civil society and community-based organizations and groups to roll out public awareness programmes aimed at destigmatizing abortion, women and girls who need abortion services, and health service providers who provide those services. As the judgment also makes it clear that obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, nurses, midwives and clinical officers can, if trained, provide safe, legal abortion services in line with the Constitution, the Kenyan government has a duty to offer these professionals training, necessary equipment and the environment to do their work without fear of reprisals. Public officers are bound by national values and principles of governance. Their actions must always be transparent, and accountable; they must strive to enhance public participation, inclusivity, non-discrimination and protection of marginalised groups in our communities.

174,True,False,0.0,[],13 August 2019 - 01:00,LEADERSHIP TUSSLE,No end in sight for Nairobi Central SDA Church wrangles,• The church leaders who spoke to the press yesterday said they were forced to expel 15 members after they unlawfully attempting to eject the resident pastor Pierre Masaai Mayua. • The 15 were also accused of and disrespecting the resident pastor.,"The regional Seventh Day Adventist Church leaders have blamed the Nairobi Central congregation’s woes on an aborted leadership selection exercise. The SDA Central Kenya Conference Executive Director John Ngunyi said the nominations process has been ongoing for the last 10 months. The church runs a two-year nomination process according to its manual. The church leaders who spoke to the press yesterday said they were forced to expel 15 members after they attempting to unlawfully eject the resident pastor Pierre Masaai Mayua. The 15 were also accused of disrespecting the resident pastor. “The process was being undertaken by a nomination committee which is the final committee. It has the mandate to discuss names, vote, write to individuals to accept or decline the nominations and read the names,” Mayua said. Mayua told journalists about the protracted differences with the 15 now expelled faithful. The group includes Sammy Masara, Enock Kinara, Humphrey Nguma, Wilfred Ndolo, Geoffrey Asanyo, Henry Osinde, Gerald Kireki and Zipporah Mokua. Others are Ebby Mokaya, Jerry Magutu, Jones Agwata, Kepha Osoro, Geoffrey Nyamasege, Erick Magutu and Friday Kinara. They were part of the church’s previous leadership. Mayua said that they attempted to eject him from office when he was away on official duty in Siaya county in late 2018. “During the last two weeks of November and early December in 2018, we went to preach in Siaya County where 276 people gave themselves for baptism,” he said. However, some elders met at Nairobi Central SDA Church at the same time and passed a vote of no confidence against me, Mayua said. “I am an employee of the conference, not the church. They have no rights to discuss us and instead should raise their issue with the conference’s president,” he said. Mayua on his return found that some of the elders at the church had tried to protect him from his ouster but they failed. “On February 9, I found a letter that read ‘You are no longer our pastor and the nominations are cancelled’,” he said. Mwayua protested the letter and told the group that he was still the legitimate pastor. He later went for instructions from the conference committee on the matter. “They were told to bring a team of seven elders out 84. They were advised to return to the church and follow the right procedure,” he said. The team had complained about a flawed nomination process. The rebels then boycotted departmental nominations of the church. Mayua said that they went ahead with the nominations as planned in four departments since they had the required quorum. “Former head elder asked them to reject the names, the nominations were cancelled, pastors recalled at end of the service,” he said. The church’s offices were later on July 23 locked using chains and padlocks by five of the members. The team claimed that police were informed of the incident but nothing happened. The leaders condemned the church’s closure by Nairobi county commissioner Flora Mworoa terming it unconstitutional. They claimed that the right procedure was not followed hence infringing their right to prayers. They said that both the parties had had several meetings with the administrator, among other government officials and resolutions reached at. “The same group of 15 came to disrupt the reading of the names by myself in church during a business meeting. The exercise, however, went on successfully, we took the vote. They went to court but the case was dismissed,” he said. The team, however, registered the Nairobi Cosmopolitan Conference Limited (NCC) before their case’s ruling. According to Ngunyi, the 15 members had on July 20 been called to defend themselves but they didn’t. One of the leaders instead insulted Mayua leading to the meeting’s disruption. The leaders threatened to move to court if the government fails to reopen the church. Mayua maintained that it was the last option for them to remove names of the 15 rebels from their records. “They circumvented the vote by bringing acrimony, the reason why I had to announce that they were no longer members,” he said. Though there are claims that the wrangles could be along ethnic lines and a scramble to control millions collected at the church, the team maintained those allegations were farfetched. The church’s leadership, they said, is drawn from all the communities across the country. (edited by O.

175,True,True,3.0,[],22 August 2019 - 00:00,TO SERVE FOUR YEARS,Nurse who procured abortion for Form 4 student loses appeal case,"• After a full trial, the magistrate convicted Francis Mutunga of killing an unborn child and sentenced him in July last year to four years imprisonment. • Judge ruled appeal lacked merit and upheld conviction and sentence on August 15.","A nurse who was jailed for four years for procuring an abortion for a 17-year-old Form 4 student has lost a bid to reverse his sentence. Francis Mutunga was charged with the offence of concealing birth contrary to law. It was alleged that on May 29, 2015, in Makueni county, Mutunga with another not before court secretly disposed the dead body of a baby girl who had been delivered by a minor, to conceal its birth. He faced a second count of killing an unborn child by administering drugs to the minor that prevented the child from being born alive. After a full trial, the magistrate convicted him on count two and sentenced him in July last year to four years imprisonment. Mutunga, however, appealed the lower court’s decision. He argued that the magistrate erred in law by relying on insufficient or no evidence to substantiate the offence of killing an unborn child in the absence of any of the primary elements of malice or aforethought. Mutunga added that he was on official duty during the commission or omission of the offence. The accused also said that the extracts produced by him showing the treatment he administered do not show any malice aforethought on his part. He submitted that the reasoning by the trial magistrate was marred by errors, and totally disregarded the defence testimony and real evidence. Mutunga also argued that the prosecution’s evidence was marred by inconsistencies and did not meet the required standard of proof. The suspect added that the evidence by the girl which the trial magistrate relied on was not corroborated and that the minor could not name the pills she was given or produce evidence of the same in court. High court judge Hedwig Ong'udi while delivering her judgment said that she did not see how premature labour could change so fast into mild abdominal pain and eventually a minor illness. She agreed with the trial magistrate that it does not require a medic to tell that premature labour is an emergency case. Further, Mutunga had said that he had referred the girl to a major hospital but his records did not reflect that. But later in re-examination, Mutunga said he had done the referral in the girl’s patient book. “So which is which?” the judge questioned. “In a nutshell, the appellant’s evidence was marred with contradictions and inconsistencies which only served to amplify his incredibility. The prosecution’s case was consistent and corroborative,” Judge Ong’undi said. As for the likelihood of ill motive alluded to by Mutunga, the judge said that the evidence on record did not point to such, not even remotely. She said Mutunga confirmed that he had no grudge with either the minor or her mother and that they had no reason to frame him for the offence. “The minor was not trying to shift blame because she had pleaded guilty and it was not shown that she had been promised anything in exchange for her testimony,” the judge ruled. The judge said the weight attached to the girl's evidence was in her view not unnecessary and that ground of appeal failed. “The result is that the appeal lacks merit and is dismissed. The conviction and sentence are upheld,” Ong'udi ruled on August 15. It was the prosecution’s case that the girl who was a Form 4 student left for school from home on May 29, 2015. She did not return home and this got her mother concerned. Her mother said that when her daughter did not return home she called the headmaster who informed her that the girl was not in school that day. The minor on the other hand testified that she had conceived in 2014 and kept it from her mother. On the days she disappeared, she was pregnant and had disclosed this to her friend who referred her to Malili who was Mutunga’s co-accused. Malili then referred her to Mutunga after giving her Sh3,000 to pay him and his phone number for purposes of communication. Her intention was to get rid of the pregnancy. The said Malili gave her directions on how to reach Mutunga. Mutunga allegedly directed her to his house where he inserted some pills in her vagina and after some time a jelly-like fluid started to flow. He then injected her on the arm. Mutunga had also wanted to have sex with her but she declined. She gave him the Sh3,000. The minor added that she went to Malili’s home who made her lie on a seat and made her strong tea. At 7:00 pm she swallowed pills given to her by Mutunga. She then felt as if she had labour pains and the foetus came out at about 11pm. She released it into a washbasin given to her by Malili who told her not to look at it as it was a taboo to do so. She felt relieved and slept. She woke up early morning and left for school though she was bleeding heavily. At school, the principal wanted to know where she had been but she declined to answer and was suspended. The money Malili spent on her was refunded by her boyfriend Joshua Mwendwa whose number she had given to Malili on request. Meanwhile, the minor’s mother was on her way to school when she met her daughter who was crying. She narrated to her all that had happened. The court heard the girl’s breasts were producing milk and she told her she had aborted and thrown away the baby. Corporal Alice Mureithi testified that Malili was a midwife who linked the girl with Mutunga a health officer at Ndibani health centre. They met and he carried out the abortion which went well as she got no complications. She went to school the next day but was sent home for absenteeism. She stated that the student was taken to Makueni hospital since she was having pain in the abdomen and breasts and it was confirmed she had had an abortion. She also confirmed that the minor took the police officers to Mutunga’s home where the abortion had been done. In cross-examination, she said Mutunga told them he is a medical doctor but he did not say whether he runs a clinic. Emmanuel Loiposha, a medical doctor from Makueni hospital said he examined the minor and the ultrasound did show that she had a complete abortion. His observation from the defence’s treatment notes showed the girl had premature labour subsequent to a pelvic inflammatory disease. Mutunga in his defence stated that he had a dispensary as a nurse and only knew the girl in court as one of the patients he had treated. That on a material day, he was not in Kivani as he was on duty at Ndimbani dispensary where he works. He later went home, about 20kms away. He said that he had an extract of an outpatient register of the material day which showed that the girl went to his clinic complaining of severe abdominal pains. He had another register on medication and another one showing the HIV status. He further stated that the patient’s pain was in the uterus and he found out that she was pregnant. He recorded that she had premature labour due to pelvic inflammatory disease. He went on to testify that the minor had vaginal discharge and itches. Since she was not accompanied by an adult he only attended to her because she told him she was 18 years of age. He denied making sexual advances at her or inserting drugs in her private parts.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-08-22-nurse-who-procured-abortion-for-form-4-student-loses-appeal-case/

CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya on Thursday announced a total shut down of counties starting mid next month should the stalemate between the Senate and the National Assembly in passing Division of Revenue Bill 2019 persists. He said county governments will not render any services starting September 16 if the two houses fail to agree. “Beginning September 16, if the issue will not have been resolved we will have no option but to shut down all counties. County staff should not expect any salaries. Some have not been paid for two months now,” he stated. He pleaded with the tow houses to come to an agreement for the sake of Kenyans. “All services provided by counties as stipulated under Schedule 4 will not be there. We are still hopeful since we heard that they will be meeting again on 11 September,” he added. The Fourth Schedule talks about distribution of functions between National and the county governments. Functions under counties include agriculture, health, trade development and regulation, pre-primary education, village polytechnics, homecraft centres and childcare facilities, county roads, fire fighting services and disaster management, animal control and control of air and noise pollution among other functions. On Wednesday, a mediation session failed to kick off after senators failed to raise quorum after only two out of the nine members showed up. The aborted meeting was a clear indication that there is no end in sight to the crisis even after the President appealed to the lawmakers to find a solution urgently. Meanwhile, the clamour for a constitutional amendment got a new entrant after governors announced that they will start their own process geared towards changing the Constitution. Oparanya said county chiefs will soon kick-start Ugatuzi Initiative, a parallel process that will run alongside the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and the Punguza Mizigo Initiative. Oparanya noted that whereas the country has a robust Constitution, which entrenches devolution of services to mwanchi, its implementation has faced a myriad of challenges. “Therefore, in order to safeguard the spirit and letter of devolution, the council intends to initialise its own process known as Ugatuzi Initiative. The council will consult with the devolution family to deliberate on the issue and thereafter launch the initiative soon,” he said. The BBI team is currently writing a report following the conclusion of public participation. It is expected to present recommendations to President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga before October 23. On the other hand, the Punguza Mizigo Bill of Thirdway Alliance Party is currently before some county assemblies for debate. Speaking at a press briefing at CoG headquarters in Nairobi yesterday, Oparanya said governors will propose key constitutional reforms that are paramount in enhancing the unity of the nation.

Eldoret, Nakuru, Nairobi and Kiambu close the top five with 160, 144, 135 , and 82 cases respectively. The five stations account for 702 cases or 34 per cent in the period. Marsabit and Narok tied for the lowest murder cases registered in 2017 and 2018 with 14. Also recording low numbers were Kajiado with 18, Garsen 23 and Chuka 24. These figures show a higher concentration of murder cases in densely populated urban zones. The figures for the distribution of offenders by gender are scarce but some reports indicate that in 2017 alone, police recorded 1, 213 cases where men had committed murder against 222 women perpetrators. While the cases that capture the imagination of the public for prolonged periods of time are those that involve wealthy, or highly connected individuals, they are usually the exceptions. Experts have linked the reported wave of murders to depression, drugs abuse, hard economic times, frustration and pressures from the society. Land and wealth conflicts have also been cited as reasons for murders.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-09-24-police-statistics-show-rise-in-homicides-in-the-last-two-years/

She is admitted at the Maralal Referral Hospital for the 17th time. It is funny that her age and the number of times she has been admitted at the hospital due to miscarriages is the same. She does not seem to recognise this irony when I speak with her. “I just want to have a child,” she tells me. Her voice so sad you can hear the melancholic backdrop if you listen close enough. Eddah has been married for half her life. Throughout this time, she has been constantly trying to get pregnant for her husband. “He beats me every time I get the miscarriages. It is such a shame in my culture,” she adds tearfully. There is much I can tell a semi-literate, highly cultural 17-year-old girl about pregnancy. But now does not seem like the time. Now, in this space and time, I am here to listen. And later tell her story to the world. Reproductive health has been a part of all African cultures since time immemorial. Yet, we have not fully learnt how some of the harmful reproductive health cultural practices are affecting our communities. Eddah was “given” to a moran before she was circumcised. From age six she started engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse. “In our culture, the moran has to build a manyatta in the girl’s home. This is the place where they spend time together when the moran is in need. “I had not started menstruating at the time. No one even told me about pregnancies and abortions,” narrates Eddah. She went on to have sexual relations with the moran for two years before she was circumcised. It was during circumcision that she learned a few things about pregnancy. She was warned that she couldn’t get pregnant before she is wed as it was a shame to her family and her taboo. “I did not get married immediately after the circumcision. Some girls have to wait a bit to get husband,” she tells. During this time, Eddah had started her menses and soon she got pregnant for the moran. Eddah told her elder sister that she might be pregnant in an attempt to get a confidant. Her sister, who had just been married off, told her she has to tell their mother. But Eddah was afraid. So she kept quiet. She hid the pregnancy. “They only came to know about it when I was 2 months pregnant,” she adds. What they did next was tragic. Eddah’s mother called her neighbour, who was also the woman who circumcised Eddah and together, they locked her in one of the family’s manyattas. They came back for her in the middle of the night. As Eddah laid on her back on the ground, the women used a can full of sand to press and hit her baby bump. “All I remember is the first hit. There were 10 women and the first one put the can on my belly and pressed down with her leg. I had not realised that some of the women had pinned me down so I could not move. I asked my mother to stop but I could not even see her face among the women,” she tells. “People in this area rarely talk about how they do their cultural abortions. Much has been done about female genital cutting but there has been a laxity in other detrimental reproductive health practices that many cultures partake in,” adds Dr Louise, Eddah’s gynecologist. Eddah was married off one month after the ordeal. “Her womb is severely damaged and it is possible that it is because of that. We have seen several young women and girls with the same condition here,” confirms Dr Louise. With the recently announced court order that the country will refer to the 2012 Standards and Guidelines for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion in Kenya when discussing the issue, it is still not clear where cultural practices that lead to abortions fall under. The Standards and Guidelines highlight the importance of educating youth on reproductive health. However, youth like Eddah, who are not only marginalised economically, but also socially and politically are being left behind. It would seem that Kenya is still not yet at the level of discussing pro-life or pro-choice consequences of abortions. We should start with the basics. The first step should be ensuring all girls of reproductive age know their health rights, understand how to lower risk of unwanted pregnancies and have access to quality reproductive health care when needed. This includes girls like Eddah, who live in hardship and whose cultures dictate their fate. * Names might have been altered to protect the interviewees More:",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-10-06-cultural-abortion-the-unspoken-cruelty-destroying-girls-lives/

She was addressing a meeting on Thursday of intersex people, supporters and lawmakers to support an intersex bill in the Senate and educate lawmakers. The group called on senators to fast-track the bill that would officially recognise the group as a third sex in Kenya. It is sponsored by Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura and is an amendment to Section 9 of the Registration of Persons Act 2012. They recounted their ordeals of dealing with stigma and high medical costs in raising intersex children. It is estimated that Kenya has more than 700,000 intersex persons. Another intersex person, Sharon Ngeru, 23, at first glance appears to be a woman with breasts. But she has a deep male voice and a beard. She was subjected to four surgeries. ""My parents took me through four surgeries to correct my weird genitalia so that they could bring me up as a woman. This became problematic as I now feel the male hormone is dominant yet they cut out the male genitals,"" Ngeru said. ""I feel I'm a man, but I don't know what genitalia I have as I do not have the ovaries or even the womb,"" Ngeru said ""But I still have a scrotum,"" she said. His/her ID indicates her as female. Besides adding a third sex in the law, the bill allows changing gender preference on the national ID of those who may have been born with characteristics of one sex — but later in life their physical attributes change. If adopted, intersex persons will have to surrender their previous national identification documents, including IDs, to get new ones. Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo, who also promotes the bill, told the gathering at a Nairobi hotel that some of her colleagues had dismissed their efforts as only legislating for a minority and for 'Western' things. ""Even if it is only one person whose rights are being violated, we must legislate to protect the rights of that person,"" she said. Most lawmakers who attended the meeting said the didn't know much about intersex issues. They said they often dismissed them as a homosexual group trying to seek legal recognition through the backdoor. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika apologised to the group and the Kenya National Human Rights Commission for dismissing their concerns. Kiambu's Jude Njomo said when invited by KNCHR commissioner Jedidah Waruhiu to the meeting, he was reluctant, thinking that it was convened by Western-sponsored groups seeking to legalise abortion or LGBTQ . ""I'm so sorry I have been indifferent to this cause because I did not know what it was all about. I will not just support the bill but also be its champion because people do not decide to be intersex, they are born that way,"" he said. Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki said he first knew about intersex during the August census when he saw the third sex marker on the enumeration forms. Kathiani's Robert Mbui also admitted ""numerous ignorances on issues around intersex"". He said, ""This emotional sensitisation meeting has made it clear for me and secured my unflinching support."" The lawmakers emphasised the need for sustained public discussion on intersex issues to increase public awareness and win their support for the group. ""This is not their making. It is just like someone can be born with a physical disability and we embrace and support them,"" Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris said.

The coalition, which includes economist David Ndii, constitutional expert Yash Pal Ghai and rights activist Maina Kiai, was on Saturday barred from accessing a venue they had paid for. Members have said the coalition will sue the Technical University of Mombasa for denying them access to the venue they had paid for to launch their outfit. They said the launch will has now been pushed to next weekend. The TUM management on Saturday made an about-turn and denied the coalition members access to one of its halls. They cited security reasons. However, the Star has seen receipts and correspondence that indicate the coalition paid Sh25,000 for the venue and that the university management had okayed the meeting. Registrar in charge of Administration and Planning Kilungu Matata, in a letter dated October 17, said the coalition’s request to hire the university hall had been approved. The request was received by the university the same day it was made; October 17. The coalition, in the request letter, said, “This will be a public event at which we hope to discuss devolution and its impact on Mombasa and the country at large.” Matata said this was subject to conditions including payment of the Sh25,000 hiring fees, covering the cost of university property lost or damaged during the function, ensuring the function ends by 2pm and keeping the university environment clean. “By copy of this letter, the security officer is requested to ensure the maintenance of law and order and provide you with the necessary assistance,” Matata wrote in the letter. On Saturday, however, the coalition members, Muslims for Human Rights chair Khelef Khalifa and many other transporters, truckers and activists were denied access to the venue at 8am. They were told there had been a change of plans. The coalition believes this was an ‘order from above’ adding that some top government officials are afraid Mombasa residents will be enlightened on the need to fight to defend their rights. “This means that someone somewhere is not doing the right thing. Only those who have things to hide can infringe of the rights of others,” Kiai said. The coalition was formed on August 2 in response to the implementation of two key policy decisions. These include the directive forcing Kenya-bound cargo to be shipped from Mombasa port via SGR and the move to privatise the Mombasa port’s Container Terminal 2. Ndii maintained that the SGR project is not economically viable. “It has been demonstrated now and accepted by government and written in a government report that this railway cannot service its debts. That is something we said from the outset,” Ndii said. Ghai said the government made unconstitutional decisions and is trying to force the decision on Kenyans. The coalition has now set in motion mechanisms to sue the TUM for denying them access to the hall despite paying for it. “They have to pay for all the expenses we incurred in preparing for the launch which they aborted in the last minute. The cost runs into millions,” a member of the coalition said. This includes paying for flight tickets for Kiai who had to come from the US for the event, they said. Khalifa said there has been a surge of propaganda spread through social media to discredit the coalition and its cause. He believes the propaganda originates from senior government officials. “We are undeterred because the government is terribly afraid of what we are agitating for – local participation for local resources,” Khalifa said.

The clerics drawn from Christian, Muslim and Hindu faiths spoke at the All Africa Conference of Churches, during a Religious Actors Pre-summit on International Conference on Population and Development. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the groundbreaking ICPD, which took place in Cairo in 1994. Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi plays host to over 8000 delegates for a three-day global summit. Concerns had been raised about specific areas in the ICPD25 program, including abortion and comprehensive sexuality education in reproductive health (SRHR), and LGBT under demographic diversity. The religious leaders on Monday from Kenya, other African countries, Latin America, Europe and the USA maintained that religion plays a crucial role in promoting the wellbeing of humanity. Director of Department of Gender, women and youth at All Africa Conference of Churches Rev. Lydia Mwaniki said religious leaders recognize and prioritise the dignity of every human being. ""We, as religious leaders and faith actors, provide enormous opportunities for and contributions to accelerating the quest for a better world,"" Mwaniki said. In a joint statement released after the pre-summit, the faith actors expressed concern over the exclusion of their perspectives, especially from the majority world. “We are minimally included in global processes such as ICPD25,” the statement read. They also decried the use of terminologies, language and winding statements that are unclear and recommended simpler, directly interpreted terms for clear understanding. The faith actors rebuked the provision of contraceptives to underage girls and boys as a solution to teenage pregnancies. "" Provision of contraceptives to underage girls and boys is not a solution for teenage pregnancies, and certainly not for STIs, nor HIV/AIDS, "" they said. The leaders insisted many faith communities have educational programs to delay the age of sexual debut and responsibilities for adults. In a collective voice, they called for concerted interventions to reduce deaths of mothers and children. ""Common and leading causes of maternal mortality especially those related to pregnancy and childbirth are known. However, global commitments lack explicit and practical ways of addressing these causes,"" they said. The clerics urged the government and its partners to provide necessary infrastructure, effective referral systems and human resources for health. They said increased skilled deliveries and quality of care is key in preventing maternal deaths caused by severe bleeding during delivery. ""Increased access to Antenatal care for pregnant women and post-natal care particularly for women living in rural settings would help address complications related to hypertension, and post-partum infections,"" read the statement. The clergy nevertheless recognised that ICPD25 has some items that are locally and contextually beneficial to the people.

Uhuru said there is need for the conference to accelerate the promise of Cairo in order to build sustainable, vibrant and inclusive societies. He said in failing to keep the promise, countries risk cosigning their children to a less secure future than they inherited. One of the 200 recommendations in the Cairo commitment stated reproductive health care should enhance individual rights. This included the “right to decide freely and responsibly” the number and spacing of one’s children, and the right to a “satisfying and safe sex life.” It said the definition was to go beyond traditional notions of health care as preventing illness and death, and to promote a more holistic vision of a healthy individual. Uhuru's remarks come amid fears that the conference seeks to advocate for abortion, lesbianism and gayism in the name of promoting reproductive health. Uhuru said the Cairo conference held in 1994 highlighted the linkages between population, poverty reduction and sustainable development. The head of state said ICPD emphasised the values of investing in women and girls, both as end in itself and as a key to improving the quality of life for everyone. ""Targets were set to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development, increase access to education, achieve sexual and reproductive health, reduce infant and child mortality rates, reduce the maternal mortality rate and also eliminate harmful gender practices,"" he said. Uhuru said the deliberations of the three-day conference should be guided by the needs, aspirations and unrealised potential of those who will not be part of the conference. ""I am referring to the 1-in-5 women from all corners of the world that this year alone, will experience gender-based violence, most likely from someone who is close to them. The 800 women and girls who die every day during pregnancy or childbirth; and the four million girls who, every year, have to endure the painful and traumatic effects of female genital mutilation,"" he said. He added, ""The more than 33,000 girls who are married off every day before the age of 18; and the millions of unemployed youth with limited hope for their future."" Uhuru said there is no doubt that, since the landmark agreement made in Cairo in 1994, there has been significant, though uneven, progress in many key areas. He said 25 years down, the world has changed in the field of population and development. This he said has increased inequalities within and across countries resulting into a greater demographic diversity. ""The world faces increased health threats including threats from reproductive cancers such as breast, cervical and prostate cancer. And there are also growing environmental pressures including the urgent threat of climate change,"" Uhuru said. ""This has made the Cairo commitments more urgent and more complex. To complete the unfinished agenda therefore requires us to develop new partnerships, mobilise political support, increase the level of international and domestic financing; and accelerate implementation of innovative and supportive interventions,"" he added. He said the conference should seek to increase access to secondary and tertiary education for boys and girls, accelerate the reduction in maternal deaths and eliminate FGM which remains one of the most serious violations of human rights of women and girls. ""I would like to restate my personal commitment and that of the government of Kenya to providing the leadership necessary to ensure that this practice ends within this generation. In April this year, we signed a landmark declaration between the governments of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiopia to address cross border FGM practice. And last week, we signed an agreement with religious and cultural elders to eliminate FGM by 2022,"" he said. Uhuru said the conference should further strive to eliminate violence against women and girls, eliminate child marriages, accelerate women’s equal participation and equitable representation at all levels of the political, public and corporate sphere and strengthen partnerships between governments, development partners, civil society organisations, private sector leaders, religious communities, women and youth organisations. The US government has accused civil society groups of using the conference to advance their agenda. Through Ambassador Kyle McCarter, US government said while it appreciates Kenya’s desire to host this week’s conference to celebrate 25 years after Cairo commitment, the reality is that pro-abortion groups are using it as a vehicle to try and further their agenda. “Unfortunately, these groups are attempting to re-write ICPD’s Programme of Action language agreed to by 179 governments in 1994 within a carefully negotiated Programme of Action with an alternative set of commitments that go beyond what was agreed to by member states in the original ICPD,” Carter said. Carter said for example, the term “Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR)” is being sold as if it were akin to the original consensus terms of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. This he said is an attempted overreach, as “sexual rights” is a concept undefined by intergovernmental consensus. He said UN organisations should not overstep their mandates and undermine the hard-fought inter-governmental consensus of governments. “As President Trump said in September at the U.N. General Assembly, We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery,” he said. Carter added, “Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life. Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child, born and unborn, is a sacred gift from God”.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-11-12-rededicate-to-cairo-commitments-uhuru-tells-icpd-conference/

The target of reducing maternal mortality by 75 per cent has not been achieved, for instance.","Armed GSU officers yesterday scattered a 'bloody' protest organised by pro-life group CitizenGo to oppose an abortion agendum at the International Conference on Population and Development. About 20 protestors pulled up two trash cans outside the KICC at 2pm, where the conference was taking place. They said the cans - spattered in red paint - symbolised similar containers allegedly used in abortion centres to discard ""baby body parts"". “We aim to show what abortion centers could do in Africa if we ever were to let our guard down. This has happened in many parts of the world, and this is what ICPD25 wants for the African countries,” CitizenGO Campaigns Director for Africa, Ann Kioko said. The protestors also displayed figure 1,048,937, which they said is the number of signatures against abortion, collected across the world. Armed General Service Unit officers arrived 45 minutes later and scattered the protests but CitizenGo, a Spain-based conservative advocacy group, said they will regroup today at 2pm. The group said 87 per cent of Kenyans do not support abortion, while 90 per cent reject homosexuality. This is according to a July 2014 study conducted by Ipsos Kenya for the Kenya Christian Professionals Forum. ""Recently, a Kenyan high court affirmed this by throwing out the registration of the Gay Coalition in that country,"" Kioko said. Abortion is illegal in Kenya, except when a woman's life or health is in danger. The Nairobi ICPD meeting marks the 25th anniversary of the groundbreaking International Conference on Population and Development , which took place in Cairo in 1994. At that conference, 179 governments adopted a Programme of Action , recognising that reproductive health, women's empowerment and gender equality are the pathway to sustainable development. The Nairobi meeting is attended by more than 6,000 participants. It was opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday morning. ""Today thousands gather here in Nairobi from over 100 countries, dozens of international organisations, over 200 civil society groups, and many leaders from the private sector,” President Uhuru said at the opening of the Summit. ""Because our women are the gatekeepers to family health, they exert such a powerful influence on intergenerational outcomes for their children,” he noted. Leaders said progress has been made since the original ICPD in Cairo, including improvements in maternal health and expanded access to voluntary family planning. But many of its aims have yet to be met. The target of reducing maternal mortality by 75 per cent has not been achieved, for instance. “We still have a long way to go before we can say that we have achieved that goal,” said Arthur Erken of UNFPA, which is co-convening the Summit alongside the Governments of Kenya and Denmark.

The officials claimed the Nairobi Summit promoted abortion as a family planning method instead of teaching young people to avoid sexual risks. Valerie Huber, a special representative for global women's health, in the US department of health and human services, also claimed the conference used 'ambiguous' terms like sexual reproductive and health rights to promote abortion. ""There is no international right to abortion. In fact, international law clearly states everyone has a right to life,"" Valerie said in a press conference in Nairobi yesterday morning. She read an unsigned statement, which she said was supported by the US, Uganda, Brazil, Belarus, Egypt, Poland, Hungary, St Lucia, Haiti and Senegal. She said they opposed policies that aggressively limit population growth, which was already declining in many countries. ""Indeed in most regions of the world today, fertility is below population replacement rates. As a result family planning should focus on both the voluntary achievement of pregnancy as well as prevention of unwanted pregnancy,"" she said. However, IB Petersen , the Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations, said the US' stand was based on a misunderstanding. ""This (ICPD) is not a UN official summit. We are not having political discussions. We will have a dialogue with them on the issues, and we don't expect everyone to agree,"" he said at the summit. The summit was organised by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Denmark and Kenya. Valerie— a well-known advocate for abstinence-only programmes — said the Trump administration still supports principles of the inaugural 1994 ICPD. ""We affirm the key foundational principles of the ICPD Programme of Action, including that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and that the family is the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened,"" she said. The press conference was attended by US Ambassador Kyle McCarter, Kiambu MP Jude Njomo and staunch Catholic MP Chris Wamalwa of Kiminini. The US government stopped funding and supporting the UNFPA in 2017, after President Donald Trump came into power, creating a $69 million funding hole. The current Republican administration, like previous such US governments, cited an amendment that prohibits foreign aid to an organisation that is involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation. The UNFPA has denied being involved in this kind of work. Over the years, the UN agency has helped bring down maternal deaths globally by 44 per cent. The organisation still has the vision of ending all preventable maternal deaths, the unmet need for family planning and gender-based violence, by 2030. On Tuesday, the UNFPA said it will cost the world $264 billion to achieve this goal by 2030. The figure comes from a joint study by UNFPA and Johns Hopkins University, in collaboration with Victoria University, the University of Washington and Avenir Health. “We now know the costs. These figures are a drop in the ocean compared to the dividend expected and the funds available. What we need next is the political will and financing to get the job done,” UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem said.

The report by Ni Gani Initiative says men also shun contraceptives because they are not involved in discussions around them. The report titled 'Kenya in 2030: Young voices on future scenarios and contraception' was released in Nairobi on Tuesday. It identified low male engagement as a factor contributing to limited access to contraception information and methods for those who need it. ""There is still a need to engage men and boys at the community level to tackle social norms, cultural practices and gender biases that inhibit the uptake of contraception services by women,"" the report says. It also advocates for an increased uptake of sexual reproductive health rights by men. The report engaged 40 youths in think tanks and concluded that patriarchy plays a key role in pushing negative perceptions on contraceptives. The n egative perceptions among men also stem from religious beliefs and cultural beliefs, it adds. The report says approximately 800,000 young Kenyans enter the job market every year with youth unemployment estimated at 35 per cent compared to the overall national rate of 10 per cent. ""At the same time, there are eight dependents for every 10 working Kenyans meaning that the average worker will often have very little to save or invest for growth."" Expert Katindi Njonjo said the government cannot talk about growth without contraception as a key factor in achieving it. ""Without population planning, the government will have to spend money for unplanned persons increasing family poverty and economic inequalities,"" Njonjo said. Dada Power Initiative secretary-general Serah Thiga said access to contraception services also improves opportunities for women to seek further education. But unmarried women and non-mothers often find themselves at a disadvantage because information and methods of contraceptives are more easily accessible to mothers after delivery, Thiga said. ""A doctor once refused to administer contraceptives to me because he said they were for the married women. He did not give me any information either on how I could keep myself safe,"" she said. The report faults health workers for not disseminating information on contraceptives to young people about to start exploring sexual activity. It was found that only 3.4 per cent of field health workers discuss contraception with young people aged between 15 and 19. ""The implication is that contraceptive messaging and provision is being left too late thus potentially increasing unwanted pregnancies and other avoidable health outcomes,"" the report says. According to the Ministry of Health, about 465,000 abortions take place in Kenya every year with 120,000 women receiving treatment from health facilities due to complications. With 49 per cent of pregnancies unplanned, 41 per cent end up in abortion with the average cost of treating resultant complications estimated at Sh4,943. By expanding the conversation around contraception information and services, the report says the government is able to tackle the root causes of abortion. edited by peter obuya",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-11-20-men-shun-contraception-because-its-a-womans-role-report/

The Status Report on Children in the Justice System in Kenya was released on Wednesday by Labour CS Ukur Yattani during the World Children’s Day at KICC. The report was prepared by the National Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ ) special task force on children chaired by Justice Martha Koome. Stealing (together with break-ins and burglaries) accounted for 7.8 per cent of the cases. The report shows that assault and drug-related offences constituted 4.1 and 1.4 per cent of the cases handled respectively. Miscellaneous offences like child neglect and cruelty, arson, murder, threatening violence, suicide, abductions, creating a disturbance as well as a few cases of truancy and fraud accounted for less than seven per cent of the cases involving children. “Sexual violence against children, especially girls, some even below the age of six years, remains disturbingly high, persistent and pervasive despite the stiff penalties provided by law,” Koome said during the launch of the report. The chairperson noted that there is delay in hearing cases involving children in courts across the country, poor investigations and inadequate training of the officers handling children’s matters. Six out of 10 cases involving children take more than six months to resolve as required by law. Thirty per cent of the cases take between one and two years, while one in 10 cases may take more than two years. Six of 10 pending cases are sexual offences, the report shows. “Out of the six institutions of justice, only one has a budgetary allocation to deal with children. Cases involving children must be first tracked. Institutions of justice should be strengthened through adequate budgetary allocation,” the report recommends. The report shows among the different types of sexual offences, defilement is the most frequent. Other related charges include incest, sexual assault, rape, indecent and unnatural acts and sodomy. The report classifies abortion and infanticide under sexual offences to acknowledge that the pregnancy must have resulted from unreported defilement. “A huge number of children, almost 80 per cent, in need of care are incarcerated in various institutions despite not having committed any offence known by law,” Koome said. The task force was appointed by the Chief Justice in January 2016. It was tasked with seeking ways of achieving a coordinated, efficient and consultative approach in the administration of justice and reform in the judicial system. It was specifically required to identify challenges that hinder the administration of justice in children's matters and provide recommendations.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-11-20-sexual-offences-account-for-60-of-childrens-cases-report/

In some cases, they daringly throw themselves in harm's way to enforce law and order. The ceremony in Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai's office in Nairobi was held in partnership with Manu Chanadaria Foundation and targeted officers whose work stood out. Geoffrey Mutunga , Richard Rotich , Eliud Ondanya , and Dennis Macharia were credited with meticulously searching for and resolving the disappearance of human rights activist Caroline Mwatha in February. The citation for their recognition read that they painstakingly followed leads in the case, tracing her steps to Njiru area in Nairobi, where it is alleged the mother of two had gone to procure an abortion. The leads landed the officers at KNH where Mwatha was said to have been referred after the procedure boomeranged, causing her excessive bleeding. Her body was then taken to City mortuary when information about the recovery filtered to the public. ""The officers uncovered the circumstances of the death and the accused arraigned,"" the citations added. However, the abortion narrative was hugely contested, with allegations from human rights quarters that she could have been killed by operatives not happy with her work in documenting police excesses. The officers were also honoured for leading raids that resulted in the recovery of arms and ammunition. Two robbers were killed in the operation. ""On September 9, they confronted people who were robbing members of the public at Baraka Ring road in Dandora Mowlem, recovering Jericho pistol, 27 rounds of ammunition and a motorcycle,"" the citation read. Daniel Sunkuli , a DCI officer attached to the Special Crime Prevention Unit, was awarded for rescuing a seven-year-old boy who was abducted by a house help. He traced him to Kawangware area. The house help had put the child in the custody of her daughter and demanded Sh7 million ransom before she could return the boy to their Muthaiga home. Sunkuli also participated in investigating and arresting suspects involved in the Sh72 million heist at a KCB bank ATM in Nairobi West. ""He managed to arrest a suspect in the case, leading him to recover Sh3.2 million in the house of the suspect's grandmother in Machakos."" Recce Squad officers Josephat Asumari , JohnBosco Ngotho , Erick Ouma , and Victor Omondi based in Ruiru were feted for bravely raiding a house of al Shabaab terrorist suspect in Likoni in September 2019, neutralising three and arresting four of them. The officers acted on intelligence that showed the terrorists were plotting an attack in the area. Police reports also described the suspects as lethal and that they had been terrorising people in Bamburi, Kwale, Kisauni and Mazeras since May. An assortment of weapons, including a G3 rifle, grenades, more than 1,600 bullets and bomb-making materials, were recovered. Also recovered were 68 air rifle pellets, nine balaclavas, military/police uniforms, military holsters & porches, rifle oil, six machetes and three knives. For his part, AP officer Richard Keino was recognised for bravely leading colleagues in repulsing 19 armed al Shabaab militants who had marooned a PSV vehicle in Lamu's Mpeketoni area.

199,True,True,0.0,[],20 December 2019 - 22:00,HEAVILY POLLUTED,Nairobi River won't regain its lost glory anytime soon,• The river has gulped billions. • It was once a sparkling wonder.,"It all started on November 14, 2007. This was just the first phase of the Nairobi River Rehabilitation Programme, which was to take three years and cost the government Sh16 billion. Today, the authorities are still grappling with a financial crisis among other problems that have hampered efforts to fix the heavily polluted river. This is the fourth attempt to have it regain its lost glory. The river that flows across Kenya’s capital city has gulped billions. Decades ago, the water from the river all the way from Lavington to Dandora, was a sparkling wonder. It abounded with fish and other aquatics like the water beetle. Then, Nairobi was referred to as the green city in the sun. But that was then. Today, Nairobi is a dead river — or nearly so. Dead foetuses, used syringes, raw human waste and hazardous industrial waste have replaced fish and freshwater organisms. So far, the bodies of 13 infants and four adults have been retrieved from the river. The youth cleaning the river now say they are undergoing emotional trauma. Past studies on its tributaries and basin showed evidence of high levels of chemical and organic pollution. Mid this year, Governor Mike Sonko asked police chiefs and county officials to investigate the dumping of bodies in the water. Komb Green Solutions chairman Fredrick Okinda said the issue is traumatising and they are being affected psychologically. The bodies are believed to come from illegal clinics that carry out abortions. Komb Green Solutions is tasked with cleaning the river. Okinda’s group has managed to partially clean the area near Korogocho slums. Many residents have, however, questioned the reason behind starting the cleanup from downstream instead of upstream. This comes even as the Environment ministry cries foul over massive budget cuts. In March, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko said lack of funds was putting the ambitious plan in jeopardy as only Sh110 million had been allocated. On July, 10, Tobiko raised concerns saying key activities at the ministry were likely to stall following budget cuts. “We are concerned about budget cuts. As you know, the Nairobi River cleanup and restoration have zero budget. Other critical projects are Ngarisha Lake Naivasha, Suswa and Lake Magadi,” he said. Tobiko said almost Sh500,000 was slashed from the ministry’s budget, a move that “seriously compromises and jeopardises the capacity of the ministry and its entities to deliver”. City Hall had allocated Sh330 million to the programme under the second supplementary budget of the 2018-19 financial year. Will the River regain its lost glory? National Environment Management Authority acting Director-General Mamo Mamo thinks so. But, this will be realised progressively. “The big challenge is the informal settlement within the riparian areas,” he told the Star. Mamo said the authority is working closely with other partners to end effluent from slums. The exercise, however, will require a lot of money. Mamo said they will enter into private-public partnership for funds. “We want to ensure we can get proper sanitation for informal settlement through innovative means. This is, for instance, giving them proper sanitation facilities, instead of flying toilets,” he said. Mamo said the challenge could be big, but with proper planning and approach, the river will be clean again. They have so far shut 52 facilities and establishments within the Nairobi River ecosystem, in a crackdown on polluters. “Out of that, we are engaging with them to ensure they comply with water quality regulations,” he said. “Some 75 per cent [of such facilities] have, however, put up effluent treatment plants that we wanted to be shut progressively, we want 100 per cent of facilities to comply. Most of them have acquired effluent discharge licences.” He said most facilities initially thought they would not enforce their orders. “They thought we would stop after a few days. They have now understood that our inspectors are always within the premises to ensure they comply,” he said. “We also sit with them to provide compliance assistance, as they tell us the challenges they have, for instance, in putting up a treatment plant according to timelines.” He said the challenge they have with Kiamaiko slaughterhouse is the sewerage system. “They are now discharging to the public sewer,” he said. “However, they will have to move as they are in the wrong place.” Mamo said the slaughterhouse is in the process of relocating to another place. The authorities have been in a cat-and-mouse game with slaughterhouse owners. It has since been established that they neither meet standards nor have operation licences.

She came to my office and told me about the miscarriage and I recommended a second ultrasound. She said she had no money to pay for the service, but we went ahead and conducted it on her,"" he added. The ultrasound confirmed that Nzilani had miscarriage. Ngugi, however, maintained that the prescribed drug had nothing to do with the miscarriage. “I told her to get through the procedure of cleaning her womb at the facility but she walked away,” he added. Nzilani said she could not accept more services at the hospital since she had lost confidence in the doctors. “I smell a rat at Kiambu Level 5 Hospital, what caused the miscarriage then if the prescribed drug to my condition then was alright?” she queried. She said she would seek the services elsewhere and not at the same facility. Ngugi said the Susten drug is meant for women whose pregnancies are at risk. “The drug has a higher dose of progesterone that gives hope to pregnancies, it sustains and protects pregnancies,” Ngugi said. In communication between Ngugi and the complainant on Monday seen by the Star, he stated, “There was no misdiagnosis, the ultrasound was good evidence for threatened abortion. Things change with time, your condition progressed from threatened abortion to incomplete abortion. What you need is an evacuation of the uterus.” Nzilani reported the matter to Kimbo police station under OB 33/22/12/2019 at 4.11pm on Sunday. According to hospital documents seen by the Star, Nzilani suffered pelvic bleeding and abdominal pain for two hours before she sought medication at Kiambu Level 5 Hospital. She paid Sh1,200 for a scan and received the prescription from a health official at the hospital. “I profusely bled before the foetus came out immediately after taking the drug. I feel that there was a problem either at the hospital where I was diagnosed and prescription made or at the Chemist where the drug was dispensed,” Nzilani said. She added, “I need justice for the lost life, my unborn baby.” The chemist had told Nzilani to go back to the doctor who prescribed the drug and confirm if it is what they prescribed. He said they didn’t know what ailment was meant for the drug to cure. “This is the right medicine. Take the drug to the doctor who prescribed it and tell him all these things you are telling us here. I sold the drug according to the prescription,” the attendant told Nzilani on Sunday.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019-12-24-kiambu-hospital-admits-prescribing-drug-to-woman-who-lost-baby/

These are just but some of the notable personalities who bade us farewell in 2019. Here is a brief look at some of the famous faces that are no longer with Kenyans as we say goodbye to 2019. KEN OKOTH The former Kibra MP was known for supporting the legalisation of bhang and had last year given notice for the introduction of a Marijuana Control Bill in the National Assembly. In 2018, Okoth was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer. He put on a brave face as he fought the illness and assured Kenyans he would win the battle. Though he responded well, that was just the beginning of his long-term treatment. “I will be using chemotherapy tablets that I can take every morning. Because my disease was discovered at a very advanced stage; it cannot be cured. It can only be managed,” he said in an interview. He was admitted at Nairobi Hospital's ICU on July 26 where he passed on. JOYCE LABOSO The former Bomet Governor, 58, died at the Nairobi Hospital on July 29 after a long battle with cancer. Laboso had been admitted at the facility's ICU since she arrived from India where she was receiving treatment. She was married in Nyanza and some of her detractors said she did not deserve to become a Rift Valley governor because she ""belonged"" to another region after getting married. Laboso had left the country on May 29 for the United Kingdom ( Royal Madden NHS hospital ) where she stayed before being transferred for further treatment in India. She had been put on full bed rest and the county office had said the number of people visiting her at Nairobi Hospital was restricted to allow her enough rest.

Michael Onchiri, Betty Akinyi, Richard Ramoya, Alexander Gikonyo, Georgia Achieng and Stephen Maina will be held pending completion of investigations. Chief Inspector Joseph Wanjohi told a Makadara court that the suspects were arrested on Tuesday in Dandora and later taken to the Buru Buru police station. They are under probe alongside other people yet to be arrested. “I and my team of investigators are yet to analyse the mobile phone handsets of the suspects used at the time of the incident, the clothes they wore, murder weapons used in the incident and yet to conduct an identification parade of the suspects,” Wanjohi told the court. He warned that the suspects could interfere with witnesses or abscond if freed on bond. Only their families and lawyers will be informed of their cells. The suspects opposed the prosecution’s application, arguing they were not flight risks and would cooperate if released on bond. “I’m sick and can’t run away from police. The officers already know where we are staying and there is no need of being detained,” Akinyi said. Read: But Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga said that as much as the suspects have a constitutional right to be released on bond, the Constitution also allows their detention because they face serious charges. He also cited public interest and the suspects’ security. He ordered that Akinyi be taken for treatment. The case will be mentioned on February 27. The DCI said Caroline died after a botched abortion at a clinic in Dandora Phase 1. It said the suspects facilitated or participated in the abortion. “On February 6, Caroline went to a clinic known as New Njiru Community Centre within Dandora Phase 1. It is believed an abortion was procured by the owner of the clinic, Betty Akinyi, alias Betty Ramoya, and one ‘Dr’ Michael Onchiri, alias Dr Mike,” DCI chief George Kinoti said. “Investigators believe that Caroline died in the clinic and the body was transferred to the Nairobi City Mortuary on February 7 at 4.42am.” Kinoti said a missing person’s report on Caroline was filed at the Dandora police station last Friday. He said records at City Mortuary indicated that the body was ferried in a vehicle with registration number KBP 677B.The police believe Gikonyo was responsible for Caroline’s alleged five-month pregnancy. Caroline’s husband, Joshua Ochieng, works in Dubai. Kinoti said Caroline and Gikonyo were in constant communication before the alleged abortion. He said investigators established that Gikonyo sent Sh6,000 for the abortion. Caroline’s family identified the body on Tuesday evening after two failed searches on Friday and Saturday last week.

205,True,True,4.0,"GORDON OUKO, EMMANUEL WANJALA AND TRIZA KIMANI",15 February 2019 - 00:15,,Pathologists find remains of a six month infant in Mwatha’s womb,,"Human rights activist Caroline Mwatha bled to death from a ruptured uterus, an autopsy shows. The postmortem conducted yesterday by family pathologist Peter Ndegwa showed Caroline’s male foetus was mutilated by surgical interference. The autopsy was conducted at Umash Funeral Home in Nairobi. “Somebody mutilated the foetus, it has no one left upper limb, it has no brain because it has been sucked out and the bones of the skull are fractured,” Ndegwa said. Chief Government Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor supervised the examination. Ndegwa's description of the injuries indicate Caroline died a painful death. The anatomical analysis, Ndegwa said, showed the foetus had come out of the uterus to the abdominal cavity where a lot of blood was found. Ndegwa said the uterus had been perforated at the back leaving “a very big gaping hole”. “Therefore, what we are seeing is that somebody somewhere somehow attempted to either dismember the foetus or remove some parts.” The pathologist said, other than the body turning pale to symbolise excessive loss of blood, there were no signs of defensive injuries on Caroline’s body. “We also found that there were needle puncher marks on the cubital fossa meaning there was some medical intervention,” Ndegwa said. The cubital fossa is the medical term for the area inside the elbow joint. He said samples have been taken from the body for toxicological analysis to establish the type of medicine Caroline was injected with. Read: The postmortem was witnessed by Haki Africa on behalf of the human rights fraternity. Also present was Caroline Mwatha's family members and Dandora Community Justice Center where Caro worked. The postmortem throws the ball in the investigators’ court. Ndegwa said they need to establish whether the attempted abortion was voluntary or forced. “This is where we need the police officers and other investigators to find out the circumstantial evidence. Was it done when she was conscious or unconscious?” Ndegwa asked. Caroline’s family and the husband said her body and that of the foetus should be prepared and carried separately. Husband Joshua Ochieng appeared deflated and surprised by the autopsy report. The report confirms DCI claims on Tuesday that Caroline died while undergoing an abortion at backstreet clinic in Dandora Phase 1. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said the failed abortion was conducted at New Njiru Community Centre by Michael Onchiri alias Dr Mike and the owner of the clinic Betty Akinyi alias Betty Ramoya. “Investigators believe that Caroline died in the clinic and the body was transferred to the Nairobi City Mortuary on February 7 at 4:42 am,” Kinoti said. Six people were arrested over the death. They include Betty, Mike, Alexander Gitau, taxi driver Stephen Maina, Betty’s son Richard Ramoya and Georgia Achieng Tabitha. Kinoti said preliminary investigations showed Gitau was the father of the unborn child. The man lives in Isiolo. Police said he was in constant communication with Caroline and sent her Sh6,000 to be used for the “failed abortion”. According to DCI, Caroline went to the clinic on February 6. Kinoti said it is believed the abortion was procured by Betty and Mike. He said a missing person’s report on Caroline was filed at Dandora police station on February 8. Records at City Mortuary indicate that the body was dropped off in a vehicle with registration number KBP 677B. Kinoti said her name was recorded as Carol Mbeki when it was dropped at the facility on February 7. Caroline’s family positively identified the body on Tuesday evening after two failed searches on February 8 and 9. Before the autopsy, Caroline’s family and activists suspected foul play. Earlier, two suspects accused of ferrying Caroline’s body to City Mortuary were detained pending investigations. The Makadara court ordered driver Martin Mwangi and loader Godfrey Otieno to be detained for 13 days. Read: TELLTALE SIGNS Speaking on Tuesday after identifying the body, Caroline’s father Stanlaus Mbai said it had signs of blood on the neck, abdomen and a deep cut on the thigh. “In early January she told us her work is sensitive and that we should not be telling people what she does,” Mbai said. Until her death, Caroline was a founder member and case worker with the Dandora Community Social Justice Centre. The social activism group documents and advocates for an end to extrajudicial killings. “It looks like there were people who were threatening and following her,” Mbai said. Haki Africa’s Executive Director Hussein Khalid said they are treating the death with “a lot of suspicion”. “There are telltale signs on the body that we are still yet to get answers conclusively to confirm what truly happened to our late comrade,” Khalid said. In a statement released after the autopsy, Khalid said Haki Africa is satisfied with how it was conducted. ""As an organization, Haki Africa is calling for speedy conclusion to the investigations to ensure those responsible are brought to book soonest,"" he said. He called for enhanced protection of human rights activists due to the nature of their work. ""The work of comrade Caroline Mwatha must live on. Her death should not define her life,"" Khalid said.

Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor supervised the postmortem examination at Umash Funeral Home on Thursday. It was witnessed by independent pathologist Peter Ndegwa who was nominated by activists. Ndegwa said Caroline died of excessive bleeding caused by “an abortion”. Sources told the Star there was male foetus in Caroline’s womb. It was dismembered. Mbai, however told the Star he was “not satisfied by the autopsy result”. He said it is hard to explain the verdict that her daughter was pregnant and that she would resort to an abortion procedure in a backstreet clinic. “It is hard to believe this, given that I have seen Caro all this while and had not noted the pregnancy,” Mbai said. Read: Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said civil society groups accepted that Mwatha died of excessive bleeding but “the autopsy alone is not satisfactory.” He said it was possible that someone offended by Caroline’s work, and who knew a her condition, could have taken advantage of it (condition) to kill her. “We need to establish whether or not she consented to the abortion procedure,” Khalid said. The activist camped at City Mortuary throughout the week and witnessed the postmortem. “The fact that the uterus was perforated and the foetus slipped into the abdomen could point to a rudimentary procedure. Was this done with her agreement or someone forced her?,” he said. An activist who declined to be named for fear of reprisal said human rights crusaders could not acceptthe postmortem examination to explain Caroline’s death. “The human rights sector has a deep mistrust of the state. It is not possible to take their words for it.” Khalid supported the claim, saying the text messages that have been circulated were suspicious. “The messages purporting to show the correspondences between Caroline cannot be trusted because they do not even show the phone numbers. “The state is the only one with access to people’s phones.

211,True,False,0.0,"Hon. Musalia Mudavadi, EGH. ANC Party Leader",17 May 2016 - 05:00,,Dialogue on electoral reforms is the way to go,,"We at ANC are unequivocal that IEBC as currently constituted cannot deliver fair, transparent, peaceful and credible elections 2017. We are convinced that a change of guard is overdue to avert chaos in the country. The IEBC has failed to exercise its broad mandate, and it’s unlikely its leadership can change its obsessively contemptuous mind-set. It would save the country unnecessary pain and open dialogue if the IEBC commissioners resigned. Their continued holdup is eating into time for reconstitution. However, for close to year, we at ANC have called for dialogue over electoral review – not just reconstitution of IEBC - but the fault lines in the country’s electoral system, its infrastructure and architecture. Our view is there is more to reconstructing the incapacity, incompetence, lack of integrity and waning public confidence levels at IEBC than just a game of musical chairs where you replace individuals. Now that we seem to be agreed that dialogue is the solution, ANC calls for an all-inclusive broad-based representation in a national consultation by major stakeholders. Elections are not just a preserve of political parties or some with representation in Parliament. Elections are about restating sovereignty of the people, legitimising their delegated power and strengthening democratic governance every so often through periodical elections. Elections are therefore not an end in themselves. Other than reviewing the mandate, operational and administrative issues at IEBC to make it more functionary effective, there are pressing constitutional and legal matters on representation as symbolised by the failed Gender Bill; the inadequacies in the Political Parties and Elections Acts; and matters essential to fair elections such as the Executive’s role in issuance of identity cards to Kenyans, Judiciary and police functions. ANC therefore believes we need to set the right mood for a plausible agenda on electoral review rather than present adversarial stop-gap measures and pre-conditions prejudicial to the very dialogue we seek. The grandstanding being exhibited could turn out to be a coordinated attempt to subvert the holding of and abort elections in 2017. Political players should not advance the suspicion that that current procrastination is intended to postpone the 2017 elections. The narrative that we will cure the malady in our electoral system for a credible election 2017 by sharing appointment of new commissioners amongst favoured few political parties is misleading short-sightedness. Such will only embed partisanship rather than secure IEBC independence. Additionally the cynical view being espoused by a section in government that only the legal process can lead to a solution underestimates of the enormity the country faces should a political settlement not be reached. It’s a disrespectful way of dismissing engagement. These entire show-off attitudes can only torpedo the very essence of seeking a resolution. It is also imperative to note that the 10th Parliament short-changed Kenyans by weakening electoral laws. The current parliament has shown only appetite to better its predecessor by weakening the constitution. Allowing self-interest to prevail over the will of Kenyans is to court disaster. Hon.

212,True,True,0.0,KIRIMI MUREITHI,04 October 2016 - 03:00,,Saving unwanted children of uncut or twin - bearing mothers,,"Among the Samburu and Rendille communities in northern Kenya, twins are considered a bad omen that deserve to be killed, children born of uncircumcised women are fed with a mixture of snuff, tobacco and cow dung and left to die in the wild, whereas those born out of wedlock are abandoned in the bushes to be eaten by hyenas. This retrogressive culture, coupled with illiteracy and uncivilisation, has made murder of unborn and newborn babies a way of life. The region occupied by the Isiolo, Samburu and Marsabit communities is characterised by harsh climate, poor infrastructure, lack of clean and safe water, poor health facilities and poor education standards. The Samburu people are nomads who herd cattle, whereas the Rendille treasure the camel. The two tribes have long lived together and intermarried, forming a hybrid culture, where each community has adopted some cultural behaviours from the other. Attempts to carry out health and civic education on families of these two communities may be an uphill task, considering the population density of 11 people per square kilometre. Rescue mission However, their story cannot be told better than through the experience of Pamela Dobban, who left Northern Ireland more than 10 years ago to come and rescue children from the archaic traditions. Pamela left her home country in 1997 and moved to Kenya, where she worked as a missionary in Tharaka Nithi county. “I stayed in Tharaka for four years, went back to Northern Ireland but returned to Kenya in 2004. I was accompanied by my husband Ken Dobban, who had retired from his banking job in Northern Ireland,” she said. They returned to Kenya to start the Kind Fund Children’s Home, whose aim was to rescue orphaned, abandoned children and newborn babies vulnerable to death due to the culture of the two communities. Pamela came into contact with the reality of the acts when she was a missionary. In her role, she frequently visited northern Kenya and saw the challenges facing orphaned children and newborn babies. “According to Samburu and Rendille culture, any baby born out of wedlock or born by a mother who has not undergone female genital mutilation is deemed an outcast. It is not recognised by the community and is not supposed to live,” she says. Moran Impunity Out of ignorance and lack of sex education, middle-aged men, commonly known as morans, are allowed to have sex with young girls irrespective of the parents’ knowledge, and no questions are raised. The worst happens if such girls get impregnated by the morans. When the elders know about it, the girl is forced to have an abortion, where the foetus is squeezed out of the womb using crude things like stones and sticks. This is done in an inhuman manner and endangers the life of the mother and the unborn child. “Many girls [at the rescue centre] are those who escape from their families once they know they are pregnant and dread being subjected to such treatment. Once we identify them, we take care of them until they deliver their babies and then take away the newborns to our rescue centre,” Pamela says. She tells of tales where some few girls who are lucky to conceal their pregnancy run away from their homes and deliver in the bushes, then abandon their children there. Kind Fund has established three rescue centres: in Ngaremara, Isiolo county; Laisamis, Marsabit county; and Wamba, Samburu county. The centres have about 120 children of various ages rescued over the years. The rescued children are fed, clothed and educated through the support of donors and well-wishers. For the unlucky girls who give birth at their homes, the elder women take the newborn away from the mother and feed the newborn with cow dung and the powdery tobacco sniffed by the elder generation, and the poor toddler is left to be eaten by wild animals, such as the scavenging hyenas that loiter in northern Kenya conservancies. Twins as ""bad omen"" If a married woman delivers twins, the husband disowns her because they consider the birth of twins a bad omen. Such a woman is regarded as an outcast and can only be readmitted to the society after undergoing a cleansing exercise, normally done as a traditional ritual. According to Pamela, the mother of the twins is required to kill them so she can be readmitted to the society. Luckily, on a few occasions, they have rescued such twins, some abandoned by the riverside to be carried away by the torrential waters. “In 2004, my dream of having a rescue centre came true and I established the first home in Wamba. Many of the children we are housing could either have been killed or eaten by wild animals, because of societal rules on mothers who have not undergone circumcision or were born out of wedlock,” she said. “It’s hard for me to change the culture of these communities, but I am happy that we have been able to save lives. Currently we have 20 newborn babies. In Wamba, three, Isiolo home is catering for seven babies, and 10 in Laisamis,” Pamela said. An Orphans appeal Damaris Achuka, an orphan rescued in Isiolo, appeals to the government and other NGOs to educate the pastoralist communities so they can stop such retrogressive cultural practices. “A baby is a gift from God. It is only through rigorous public education of the communities that we can make them stop these behaviours, because they have been overtaken by time. I am happy to have been rescued and alive,” she said. Achuka is happy and continuing with her education and says once she is through, she will pursue a course in discipleship. Moses Ekale, another beneficiary of the centre, says he was abandoned by his parents at the tender age of five, having lived with his parents in secret. “After being abandoned, a villager noted that I was an orphan and informed Kind Fund, who came and took me to their centre,” Ekale said. “I’m happy I am getting education which will help me come back to my community and try to beseech them to stop such practices because they are bad.” He further appeals to the parents not to abandon their children regardless of the tradition and the difficulties they face because “every child is a blessing from God”. Pamela says irrespective of their work in the community, they face various challenges, such as hostility when they go to rescue the babies, as residents insist such children deserve to die. “Kind Fund cannot reach all parts of northern Kenya. Religious people, NGOs and the government should team up and work hard to penetrate the interior parts of this region to educate the communities so they can do away with this culture,” she says. Ngaremara Kind Fund employee Rose Muya, a mother of six who lives in Isiolo, appeals to young mothers to take care of their children, because if well nurtured, they can be productive people in the society. Ngaremara Kind Fund manager Akoe Ashue says at first, the homes started as orphan rescue centres. However, with time, they found the need to venture into rescuing newborn babies born out of wedlock and mothers who have not undergone FGM.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2016-10-04-saving-unwanted-children-of-uncut-or-twin-bearing-mothers/
213,True,True,1.0,MATHEWS NDANYI @ndanyi_mathews,14 November 2016 - 05:00,,A worrying trend: Teenage pregnancies on the rise,,"Sixteen year old Janet Chebet from Turbo sub-county in Uasin Gishu is already a mother at her young age. She was forced to drop out of class 8 at a local primary school in the area and did not even have chance to sit for her KCPE exams last year. “My teacher asked me to be his friend and after some time I got pregnant. I now have a baby and would have wished to go back to class but I have to stay home and take care of my baby”, she says. Chebet says she can not go to repeat class eight in same locality because she feels embarrassed and has become the laughing stock for her former school mates and age mates in the area. She is just one among thousands of girls in the Rift Valley region which is recording an alarmingly high number of cases of teen pregnancies that have led to an equally high dropout rate of girls from schools in the region. Parents, teachers and education stakeholders are worried that with the long holidays this year, the problem may worsen next year thus affecting girl-child education in the region where the girls still face many more challenges including FGM, early marriages, defilement and other harmful cultural practices. Schools in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Marakwet have in the last two years recorded high dropout rates with Uasin Gishu standing out the most affected. Records from government offices in the region indicate that at least 400 girls have dropped out of schools in the county due to pregnancies in the last three years with Turbo sub-county worst affected. Chebet is among 22 girls aged between 14 and 16 years had dropped out of Chepsaita, Osorongai, St Peters Soin and Boinet primary and secondary schools in Turbo Sub County and Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno says many more cases have been reported in the region. Governor for the area Jackson Mandago and Chemno have teamed up to help fight teen pregnancies and other challenges which affect education standards in the region. “We have invested heavily in the education sector including giving our bursaries to support our students and we are totally against anything that may particularly affect girl childe education”, said Mandago. He says the county will not allow early pregnancies to ruin the lives of young girls. “The problem of early pregnancies for school girls is very serious and we have to tackle it if we are to ensure that our girls pursue education to highest level possible”, said Chemno Chemno pushed to have 22 men responsible for the pregnancies in Turbo but he regrets that the cases have taken too long in courts yet the young girls have already paid the price dropping out of schools with some turning into young mothers with a bleak future as they have no means to earn a living. Many of the suspects charged before the courts in Eldoret have denied offenses including defilement, having carnal knowledge with minors and impregnating school girls and police argue that the cases have to follow due process just like other crimes hence the delays. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan says the pregnancies among school girls are also very high in slum areas of Eldoret town and other centers thanks to high abuse of drugs and alcohol among youth along with other causes. “As a society we have to go deeper and look into the problem of teen pregnancies, defilement of young girls and the high drop out rates of girls from our schools”, says Hassan. Indeed the government, teachers and parents are looking at the reasons behind the increased teen pregnancies in the region. Teachers, boda boda operators, drivers, touts and idle youth are being blamed for the pregnancies and Chemno says regardless of who they are the law should not spare anyone involved in impregnating schools girls. Chairman of the Muslim Preachers and Imams in Rift Valley along with Bishop Cornelius Korir of the Catholic Church in Eldoret argue that society has lost its morals to the extend that adults fail to take care children or school girls in uniform whom they come across. “Apart from the pregnancies we even have a very many cases of abortion among the young girls and as a church and parents we must devise ways to take of the girls through good parenting, guiding and counseling”, said Bishop Korir. He says parents have become too busy leaving the responsibility of guiding girls and other youth to second parties like teachers, peers and strangers. The Catholic Church has insisted that it will not accept have sex education introduced in schools in the country yet some stakeholders argue that such education would have been vital in creating awareness among youth on the dangers of engaging in premature sex activities. Korir says having sex education in schools amounts to selling human dignity and misleading the youth. Korir says parents must be allowed to continue playing the role of guiding school children on morality and discipline. “Now we have the long holidays and parents should not behave as usual. They must take extra care especially for the girls because unless they do so we are likely to record high incidences of pregnancies among girls who may then be forced to drop out of schools next year”, said Bini. He said the long holidays may come along with increased immorality among youth, drug and alcohol abuse that will lead to such pregnancies and other dangers to the youth. In the same county twenty girls dropped out of Songoliet mixed day secondary school due to pregnancies and the school Principal Sypro Kizito says the girls were impregnated mostly by boda boda operators in the area. Kizito wants leaders and the community in the area to help up put up boarding facilities for girls so that they can live within the school compound. “As a teacher I have noted that we are overexposing our girls to strangers while they are away from schools and home. These incidences can be reduced by having many boarding schools for girls”, she says. She says while on transit to and from the day schools many girls and handled by the boda boda operators and other matatu touts who in many cases mislead the young girls causing them to engage in premature sex that leads to pregnancies or spread of diseases like Hiv ads. Chairman of the National Parents Association Nicholas Maiyo says they are equally concerned with the high incidences of pregnancies in schools and that they will discuss the issue with the government and other stakeholders in the education sector. “Our focus should be on having our education system to be more child centered and this means that both girls and boys must be looked at equally in terms of issues that may affect their progress”, said Maiyo. He said they will collect national data from schools and other details on the pregnancies to help develop interventions. Chemno says it’s unfortunate that some of the case involve teachers in the affected schools mostly the untrained teachers employed by school BOGs. He says even though the country faces a shortage of teachers, schools should not be allowed to hire untrained teachers because they have not gone through the necessary training to be able to handle school girls while on duty. Out of the 22 men facing charges for impregnating the girls in Turbo area, eight of them are untrained teachers and many cases involving such teachers have been reported across the region. Teachers Union KNUT official Alice Tuwei says while the shortage of teachers is a well-known fact says any such cases involving teachers should be handled through the due process. “Pregnancies among school girls is a worrying issue and we need to look into the matter wholistically in terms of who is involved, why, effects, and interventions”, said Tuwei. Four cases of defilement of children are recorded in Kitale town of Trans Nzoia County every week and records indicate that many of the cases end up in pregnancies that cause girls to drop out of schools Director of the children's department in Trans Nzoia County Esther Wasige says many other cases go unreported and the records so far are alarming. “With the statistics we have its evident that the girl child is an endangered species. We are working with parents, teachers, religious leaders and counselors to ensure that we come up with solutions to the problem”, said Wasige. It’s estimated that Trans Nzoia has more than 150 girls dropping out of schools last year due to pregnancies. Four month ago the government ordered officials at Moi Girls Kapsowar High School to re-admit eight pregnant girls who had been expelled and bared from registering to sit for this year’s KCSE exams. Elgeyo Marakwet County Director of Education Sabina Aroni directed Principal Dinah Cheruiyot to ensure the girls are registered and she says schools should look into ways of helping such girls continue with their education by resuming school in different locations to avoid stigmatization. Due to the problem of early pregnancies complicated with the FGM practice, Elgeyo Marakwet recorded more than 300 girls who dropped out of schools last year and education officials complain that due to the same problems the transition rate for girls from primary to secondary schools is quite low. There are no clear data on girls affected but West Pokot and Baringo are also among the regions with high rates of teen pregnancies. In the case of Uasin Gishu, Chemno was also on the forefront of pushing to have the girls in Turbo area re-admitted to schools after giving birth. “The girls must be given a second chance to get education and as stakeholders we have to strongly support their rehabilitation while ensuring that justice is served on those responsible for ruining the lives of the young girls”, said Chemno. But Hassan regrets that many such cases of pregnancies or defilement of young girls are handled through Kangaroo courts within communities where the perpetrators end up going scot free while the young girls and their parents are left to bear the burden in their lifetime. He says the Children Act and other legal provisions to do allow such means of handling these criminal cases in local ways which only help to increase such pregnancies because perpetrators remain roaming the villages as heroes “We can not allow such serious criminal acts to be handled in kangaroo courts when there are clear legal provisions to deal with those involved”, says Hassan adding that parents or officers found condoning such kangaroo courts should be arrested and prosecuted along with the men responsible for the pregnancies. At national level Chairperson of the Anti-FGM board Linah Kilimo is a member of a committee planning the launch of a major campaign against early marriages in all counties in the country. She says many girls fall pregnant while still in school and are forced to drop out for early marriages. “We want to have a national approach to sensitize communities on this matter of teen pregnancies, early marriages and FGM”, says Kilimo. She says the girls who get pregnant early in life are exposed to many health risks and some end up suffering serious complications like Fistula The Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organization (MYWO) says it will help to fight increasing cases of defilement of children and teen pregnancies in the region. Women leaders from 14 counties in the region led by Ann Kibet met in Eldoret and said they would sensitize communities not to condone such cases by protecting suspects. “Some of the cases even involve relatives to the young girls but whatever the case they must be made to face the full force of the law”, she said. All stakeholders agree that if the problem is not dealt with villages across the country will be full of illiterate young girls who are mothers a situation which would be a reverse of efforts to improve the standards of education and healthcare for all Kenyans.

214,True,True,0.0,MKAMBURI MWAWASI @MkamburiM,21 December 2016 - 08:15,,"Mombasa slum dwellers taught safe delivery, family planning",,"A German foundation has equipped women in the slums of Mombasa with knowledge on issues of safe motherhood delivery. The women are taught through different economic and health delivery programmes. Mombasa county is the major beneficiary of the EU-funded project. Some 40 per cent of the population lives in informal settlements in Tudor Moroto slums, Maweni and Ziwa La Ng’ombe in Nyali and Soweto slums. Through the project, dispensaries and clinics have been upgraded to meet the public demands and standards. Maweni clinic and the Mikindani health centres are some of the facilities which benefited. They received equipment to offer affordable and quality services to the poor residents of Mombasa. The project, titled: ‘Together for mothers and children’, aims to strengthen health delivery systems in the informal settlements. It was launched two years ago and residents have reaped big from its implementation. It is funded by the European Union and implemented by WOFAK and DSW (German foundation for world population). It has also supported the process of developing the Mombasa county nutrition action plan, as well as ensuring all the groups the project is working with have something running for their economic growth and development by giving them technical and financial support. The household visits and peer education sessions have enabled pregnant mothers know the importance of self delivery through visiting health centres. This was not the case earlier, when mothers were seeking traditional birth attendants during delivery. Fewer unplanned births Kisumu Ndogo residents Ann Aswani and Grace Akoth have been carrying out peer activities. They urge women to ignore misconceptions and myths on contraceptives and adopt family planning methods to reduce the maternal mortality rate. The two can attest to how the project has impacted at least 600 women at the Kisumu Ndogo slums, an area labeled as a hotspot for traditional myths and misconceptions on matters of family planning. “The household visits and community education sessions have enabled mothers to know the importance of visiting clinics, which was not practised before due to traditional beliefs and myths. Mothers could wait until later stages or go for the card and ignore other visits,” said Akoth, a mother of one. Teresiah Achieng, now 43 years old, is a retired traditional birth attendant from Kisumu Ndogo village within Maweni slums of Mombasa. Since she was trained as a Safe Motherhood Champion, she says the number of unplanned births has drastically reduced. She says since the implementation began, home deliveries have reduced by at least 40 per cent due to the intervention by the trained ambassadors. DSW programme officer Judy Mboku says since the launch of the project, residents are now benefiting from a series of peer trainings, therefore empowering them. Both women and children targeted “We have done a lot of engagement to the vulnerable groups, targeting both women and children to improve comprehensive health care service information and supplies to 600 women of reproductive age group living in Bangladesh and Maweni informal settlements,” she said. Some 41 per cent of 208 million pregnancies occurring each year are unplanned. About half of them end up in abortion. This has raised serious concerns among health players, who are calling for quick government intervention. “We need to do more to ensure our women survive pregnancy and child birth. This is a promise for quality life for all Kenyans, and this lies in embracing contraceptives,” DSW regional coordinator George Ouma said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2016-12-21-mombasa-slum-dwellers-taught-safe-delivery-family-planning/
215,True,True,2.0,By SUSAN MUHINDI @muhindi_suu,10 January 2018 - 00:30,,Laikipia sisters embody teenage pregnancy crisis,,"Among the hundreds of thousands of teenage mothers Kenya produces each year is one Semeyian (not her real name) Laikipia county. At only 14 years old, Semeyian is already a mother to a six-months-old girl. Her breasts are still far from being fully developed, which forces her to rise up early in the morning to fetch goat milk and feed her baby with the help of her 48-year-old mother. Her homestead has two manyattas, and out of one comes Semeiyan. She is wrapped in a red Maasai shuka, shielding herself from the cold. Surrounded by her mother and elder sister, who is 17 years old and eight months pregnant, Semeyian struggles to hold her baby. She is saddened by the fact that her boyfriend, whom she dated for one year, decided to run away after realising she was heavy with his child. “I met my boyfriend in September 2016. He was my neighbour. We dated for a few months and along the line we had unprotected sex. It was our first time and we never thought of using a condom. When I told him I was pregnant, he cut all ties with me and up to date, I cannot reach him on his mobile phone,” Semeiyan says. Her boyfriend, who is 20, is a gatekeeper at a ranch in Nanyuki. The mother of the young man, she explains, often doesn’t want to see her. It saddens her because she thought the young man cared about her and her welfare. Also of concern to her is the lack of proper education or mentorship on matters sexual education, which she says would have influenced her decision on whether to sleep with her boyfriend. “My mother tried to talk to the parents of my boyfriend but they didn’t listen. I regret what I did. I wish I thought twice about it and concentrated more on my studies. But I am still determined to go back to school and finish my education. I want to become a teacher in future, an idea that my mother has supported,” she says. GLOOMY STATISTICS Over 300,000 adolescent girls aged 10 to 19 years became pregnant between July 2016 and June 2017. Narok county had the highest burden of teenage pregnancies with a rate of 40 per cent, surpassing the national average of 18 per cent. Narok was followed by Homa Bay at 33 per cent, West Pokot at 29 per cent, Samburu at 26 percent, while Isiolo and Laikipia recorded 19 per cent. The statistics released by the Health ministry put the total number of pregnant girls at 378,395. Semeiyan’s elder sister Naipanoi (not her real name) also dropped out of school while in form 3. When the organisation sponsoring her education found out she was pregnant, it discontinued her scholarship. This worried her mother, who had pegged all her hopes on the fourth-born child. Naipanoi is almost due now but has never attended a clinical visit, as is required of a pregnant woman. She explains that the lack of money has made her pregnancy very difficult. She once tried to get the opinion of a midwife from the area but was told to first visit a clinic and have a number of tests carried out on her. Although she gets to feel the kicks of her baby in the womb, she still needs to undergo some blood tests. The fact that she has never been to a hospital to assess the condition of the baby brings her to tears. She tries to fight it but it overwhelms her. Naipanoi also suffered the same fate as her sister Semeyian. After dating her boyfriend from a nearby homestead for close to a year, the young man ran away and left her to deal with the new responsibilities alone. The remorse, she says, will eat at her every day of her life. “I am haunted by guilt. My heart is heavy because of what I have put my mother through. She had high hopes in me but here we are both pregnant. We have added to her troubles. I feel terrible about it, more so since my boyfriend decided to leave me with this child. I don’t know what I will do,” she sobs. Her mother, who reeks of alcohol and sells miraa (khat) and charcoal for a living, says she cannot throw away her children because of the unfortunate incidents. “Naipanoi’s case saddened me the most. I had very high hopes in her. But they remain to be my children and I will do whatever it takes to fend for them. I know I’m not cursed, this is just bad luck. It’s the devil,” she says. She insists the rich kids from the neighborhood have taken advantage of the weak and vulnerable ones because they know they have nowhere to run to. SHUTTERED DREAMS Being pregnant has shuttered Naipanoi’s dreams of becoming a nurse. Thoughts of abortion have crossed her mind but she resorted to keep the baby. The teen intends to go back to school and finish her education. She vows never to get married until she achieves her dreams. “I would advise girls my age not to engage in premarital sex. And if you are ever caught in my situation, don’t think about abortion because God will take care of it. My hope is in Him. None of my friends have visited me. It deeply disturbs me. But I will overcome,” she says. Naipanoi hopes the organisation that funded her education forgives her and reconsiders her case. The two girls’ stories are glaring indications that sex among youths begins early and is approaching endemic levels, if nothing is done to stem the trend. The girls’ mother pleads for the purchase of some miraa so she can get something to fend for her girls. Her elder children include two girls who have already been married and a man who is yet to settle. Her last born is a son aged 10. WHY TREND PERSISTS According to a policy brief by the Health ministry, teenage pregnancy persists for a number of reasons, including inadequate access to reproductive health information and services, cultural and religious taboos, and poverty. It further states that sex education is inadequate in schools and at home. Few adolescents receive comprehensive sex education, and often teachers do not have sufficient training to give students correct information. While the Education ministry acknowledges the need to provide information on sexuality, the lack of access to comprehensive sex education in schools contributes to teenage pregnancy and its consequences. Childbirth can be especially risky for adolescent girls and their babies. Maternal death rates for young women aged 15 to 19 are twice as high as for women in their 20s. Research suggests that girls aged 10 to 14 are five times more likely to die of maternal causes than women aged 20 to 24. First-time adolescent mothers are at most risk. A separate study conducted by the African Population and Health Research Centre found that lack of accurate sex education in schools is leading to a high number of pregnancy among students. The report released in September showed that by the time girls are 19, half of them in schools are usually sexually active, about 40 per cent are married, and close to 20 per cent have children.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-01-09-laikipia-sisters-embody-teenage-pregnancy-crisis/
216,True,False,0.0,JOSEPH NDUNDA @Joseph_Ndunda,16 May 2018 - 00:30,,Remandees detained longer on trial than they would if convicted,,"The country's 94 prisons continue to grapple with congestion and financial burdens of taking care of inmates. The correctional facilities have a holding capacity of about 27,000 prisoners but are currently holding in excesses of 54,000, which is more than double their capacity. Half the inmates are convicts of petty offences and pre-trial remandees facing prosecution for minor offences. A senior prisons official who is not authorised to speak to the press said congestion of correctional centres by convicts of petty offences and remandees is a systematic problem. ""Most end up serving longer sentences in prison while on trial than they would if convicted. I am not saying they are serving a sentence but they are in prison before they are convicted,"" the officer said. ""You get a person who is accused of theft by relatives, for instance. Because the judicial system runs very slowly, once you are charged, you are given a first hearing date in three months. You come after three months and the investigators have not presented any evidence or witness, and therefore, are not ready to proceed, and you get another date after three months. ""You are lucky to appear in court for more than three times in a year and even those three appearances are not sufficient for trial. The second appearance after plea is always mention, the third time is an aborted trial after three months and they don't have witnesses or only one or two witnesses have testified and the year is over. ""Where do you create a balance between the rights of the complainant and those of the accused person? Much as you want to protect the rights of the accused person, the investigators would tell you that they have a prima farcie case, whose bearing is the allegations, just because someone alleged that you stole their chicken.” RISING BACKLOG The offences categorised as petty are defined by the state in terms of legislation mostly outside of the Penal Code and other minor offences that should not be criminal. Most of the offences typically do not have a complainant other than the state and relate to the regulation of formal or informal economic activity, where a particular state interest is being protected, such as regulation of alcohol use, hawking, protection of the environment or enforcement of traffic rules. Data from the 14 magistrate’s courts surveyed by the ICJ Kenya found 75,000 accused persons in two years, with a high proportion of less serious offences. There are 116 court stations in Kenya, which suggests more than 230,000 cases. The ICJ report said if all cases were to be resolved in a year, it would require the current 455 magistrates to resolve 500 cases per year. ""This illustrates the pressure placed on the [criminal justice] system by the high number of referrals of petty offence cases,"" the report reads in part. Secretary of prosecutions at the office of the DPP Dorcas Oduor said when they visited Nairobi Area remand allocation on February 10, there were 2,500 inmates who ought not to have gone to court. The number rose to about 3,000 before they made their report in two weeks. ""The problem is once you have taken a plea and you have been taken to remand, it is not easy to just call for the file and dismiss the charges. We have been calling for the files from the police, reviewing them and going to court and making applications to withdraw, and we have done quite a number,"" she said. DPP'S INTERVENTIONS Oduor said they are intervening by taking measures to limit the number of cases that end up in courts. The ODPP is looking at the door through which the cases are coming in ""because it is useless to go to prison to deal with petty cases without addressing the way they come in"" to arrest them at that level. She said that is the reason the prosecutors have been told to be diligent before they admit cases so that petty cases that should not go to court are dropped. ""We are also looking at crimes that we can address, such as traffic offences. Some of them are petty and should not be criminal in the first place. Even if they were criminal, it is not cost-effective to take people to remand. So the DPP is looking at that and will be issuing guidelines on how prosecutors will be dealing with traffic offences,"" she said. ""We are also saying if there could be an easier way of people paying their fines or bonds because with traffic cases, people are not given time to pay. When you are arrested, they [police] want an equivalent of the fine, which is Sh10,000. If you don't have it you are taken to court and go to remand. We want to look at other strategies, how we can expedite the process and make people, for example, be given time to pay the fines."" Oduor said in some countries, after committing a petty offence, one is given two weeks to make up their mind whether they want to plead guilty or not. ""If you know you committed the offence then you easily plead guilty and you are given a paybill number to go and pay fines — that is what happens in Tanzania. But here it is criminal and it has to go to court,"" she said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-05-15-remandees-detained-longer-on-trial-than-they-would-if-convicted/
217,True,True,2.0,By JOSEPH NDUNDA @Joseph_Ndunda,26 September 2018 - 06:00,,Is killing a pregnant woman a case of double homicide?,,"As Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his alleged accomplices face charges in relation to the killing of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno, the fact that she was pregnant adds a layer of legal intrigue. Can a murder suspect be charged with killing an unborn baby if he is accused of murdering an expectant woman? The seven-month pregnant Sharon was raped and stabbed eight times and her unborn baby killed on September 3. Obado was charged on Monday with aiding and abetting her murder. Lawyers have differed on whether DPP Noordin Haji can sustain charges against the suspects for murder of the foetus. Lawyer Shadrack Wambui says he can. He says from a constitutional perspective, as is in Article 26 of the constitution, life begins at conception. So if a foetus is killed, someone can be held to be responsible for that murder. However, Wambui says the question that will then avail itself in the circumstances Obado finds himself in is whether he can be charged with two capital offences. Read: Also read: Usually, the practice of criminal law is that when one has been charged with more than one count of capital offence, the court suspends the other charges for the simple reason that one cannot die twice. Wambui says although courts have always held the view, the prosecution can withdraw that one charge [murder of foetus] under Section 87 A of the Criminal Procedure Code, so that if he [Obado] is acquitted of the charge of Sharon’s murder, the possible scenario, then the DPP can bring another charge and prosecute for the murder of the foetus. The lawyer says it is a question of discretion that the court and DPP have. The DPP does not lose it by charging right now only the offence of murder of Sharon. ""This is a catch-22 situation. He [Haji] can choose to assume it [foetus’ murder] for now or wait for the proceedings to take off and the ruling of the court. If the court holds him culpable or guilty of that offence [Sharon’s murder], then it will mean that if he will be convicted and sentenced to death, then there will be no wisdom in charging him for the second charge of the murder of the foetus,"" he said. ""But if he is acquitted of this one, the DPP has all the legal rights to prefer another charge for the murder of that foetus. It arises from common sense. You see you cannot die twice but the Supreme Court has held that death sentence cannot be the only available sentence for the offence of murder. Therefore, one can be sentenced to life imprisonment or any other sentence the court will deem fit."" NO MALICE AFORETHOUGHT But lawyer Stanley Kang’ahi differed with Wambui. Kang’ahi argued that the death of a foetus in a woman’s womb can either be as an issue of abortion or state of miscarriage but can’t be murder. Read: "" My understanding of death of foetus inside the womb is always a question of abortion and miscarriage or any other term, but definitely not murder. Murder in law has its precepts of malice aforethought and intention to kill. You must establish the intention that the person had against the unborn,"" he said. Kang’ahi argued that there is no conscience for a person to hold a grudge against an unborn to be said to have wanted to kill the unborn child. Therefore, proving murder of a foetus would be difficult. But Wambui said proving murder of foetus is quite simple. He says prosecution only needs to prove an act [that led to the death] and that that act is the stabbing of the mother. ""A pathologist has to prove that this foetus is dead. Once we have an act that led to the death of a foetus then the DPP can charge you, get a conviction and a sentence against you for the murder of that foetus. It flows from logic that once an act has been done, which act can be linked to the death of that foetus, then the prosecution can be sustained and a case can be made,"" he said. ""It flows from legal reasoning. When you do something, something else is likely to occur. By stabbing the mother and the child, death happens to be the result because you don’t expect to stab and kill the mother then sustain the child. An intention can be deduced from that act — by killing the mother, it is also logically reasonable to conclude that you also wanted to kill the child."" DEPENDENCY THRESHOLD Kangahi says although community organisations perceive that life begins at conception, the key ingredients you must satisfy in the charge of murder place the prosecution at a hard place. He says the whole thing is a question of academic discussion. In the matters of criminal procedure, there is nothing tying any suspect, governor notwithstanding, to the death of foetus. Kang’ahi says until the birth of a child, the foetus is still part of the mother; it is entirely dependent wholly on the mother. Therefore, it is obvious that it can’t be dissociated from the mother. He says there can’t be a complaint at the behest of the foetus suggesting that it was murdered because the law might not be able to prove the same. ""If you have an argument with someone over some money and five minutes later they are found dead not very far, then it is easier to conclude that the argument escalated and ended up in death,"" he said. ""If a baby dies in the womb and causes the death of the mother, will you accuse the foetus of the death of the mother? If a doctor had a medical situation where he has to remove the foetus and it [removal] causes the death of the mother, would you link the death of the mother to the doctor? ""It was an inevitable medical condition that caused the death of the mother."" Dr Joshua Matu said one can only be charged with murder of a foetus if the death occurred at a time when the foetus can survive without dependency on the mother. Dr Matu said a child must have attained a weight of 350g to be able to survive outside the mother’s system. ""If the mother is killed once the child has reached the point they can survive outside the mother’s system, then the suspects can be charged with murder of both the mother and the child. But if the death of the mother occurs at a time the child’s status per development is not compatible with life [without the mother], then that case is different altogether,"" Dr Matu said. ""However, if the child has not developed to that particular stage — where they can survive even if the mother is killed, then you can be accused of killing both. The baby must be able to survive in an incubator or by their own if extracted from the mother.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-09-26-is-killing-a-pregnant-woman-a-case-of-double-homicide/
218,True,True,1.0,By Ramadhan Rajab @rrajab,12 October 2018 - 06:00,,We are what we consume: Ezekiel Mutua proud as tenure ends,,"Throughout his tenure as CEO of the Kenya Film and Classification Board, Ezekiel Mutua has courted controversy. The man with a moustache and thick, properly combed hair is weeks away from finishing his term, but Kenyans will not forget him in a hurry. There are those who have seen him as a moral police. Others as a man punching above his weight. And others still as a petty man obsessed with himself and craving publicity to stay relevant. Mutua, whose term elapses early next month, is keeping his fingers crossed. His continued stay at the helm will be determined by a new board, against opposition from a section of the public who feel he is trying to babysit them, and from filmmakers who accuse him of strangling their trade. But biting more than he can chew is not new to the man. Back in 2008, when he was the Information director at the then Information ministry, Mutua threatened to disband the Media Council of Kenya for what he claimed was playing with government. The council had formed a team to audit how journalists had covered the 2007 general elections, which angered him. He reacted with the hope that his actions would endear him to then President Mwai Kibaki, who was commencing his second term after protracted and violent polls. To journalists, Mutua invokes memories of their ‘stolen’ television sets. Before 2006, when he was the Kenya Union of Journalists secretary general, Mutua was a defender and friend of scribes. He started transforming himself to a foe when he bungled the 2006 media awards, by failing to deliver the prize money and televisions sets to winners. BANNING SPREE In 2017, he kicked off a storm by banning billboards and broadcast advertisements with strong sexual, alcohol, gambling and violence appeal. Also in his blacklist were betting adverts, witchdoctor posters, as well political commercials that demean politicians and their parties and manifestos, and those that strengthen stereotypes. He warned broadcasters who did not toe the line of dire sanctions. The ultimatum drew the wrath of the Communications Authority of Kenya. CAK director general Francis Wangusi dismissed the board as having no powers to issue such demands to police broadcasters on the programming code. Mutua was not deterred. In his next sensational act, the self-styled anti-gay crusader posted a photo on Facebook, posing with his passport and visa in September 2016. “Because of my moral values, including the banning of content promoting LGBT and atheist culture in Kenya, someone wrote in a local daily that I will never get a visa to the USA,” he wrote. “I not only got it but it came on a diplomatic passport and I didn’t even have to go to the Embassy for biometrics or pay the visa applications fee. It was delivered to my office free of charge thanks to our efficient Foreign Affairs ministry and highly courteous US Embassy officials. America, here we come. To God be the glory.” The stunt ended up sparking a diplomatic row pitting him against the Immigration department, who ordered him to surrender the travel documents upon entry in Kenya, as he was not qualified to hold a diplomatic passport. Mutua ate humble pie. This year he’s caused a stir after banning safe abortion promotion and lately the ‘Rafiki’ lesbian love film. ‘HUNGRY FOR POWER’ Bloggers Association of Kenya chairman Kennedy Kachwanya describes Mutua as a man hungry to exercise powers that don’t exist in his purview. “We can say the man is passionate about his work. Unfortunately he behaves like a tethered man in a small room whereas he wants to roam free, making him act and overstep his mandate in almost all the occasions,” Kachwanya said. “His mandate is strictly to classify films. It means all he is supposed to do is categorise a film as suitable for under-16 or those above 18 years or whether it should be aired at night or during the day. But he does less of that and has concentrated on playing to the gallery, banning this and that in the name of morals.” The bloggers’ head said the creative industry needs free space to operate, accusing Mutua of gagging artistes and, thus, scuttling any efforts to grow. “He seems to be a sadist, too. For instance, he celebrated when Rafiki, a Kenyan-produced film, missed out on the Oscars. Who does that?” Kachwanya asked. Blue Sky Films managing director Jim Shamoon said Mutua is hardworking and results-oriented, though he lacks objectivity in executing his mandate. Without a gazette notice or presidential executive order, he took over licensing of films, and this has seen reluctance by producers to submit their work for licensing, Shamoon said, adding that Mutua also insists on classifying scripts before the films are made. “His purist approach has discouraged producers and led to cancellation of big international film production deals. Kenya has become hostile to the film industry because of this increasing censorship,” Shamoon said, adding that Mutua has had a polarising effect on the sector. “In his agenda, he left out those perceived as upmarket producers and those who bring in big film business. He engaged more slum and small-time producers, which he regards as the only stakeholders, which is populist. He should instead involve every player and focus on the business model of film industry,” he added. During last year’s Oscar Awards, a source who travelled to the US told the Star that Mutua had travelled for the annual ceremony, though he was blocked from attending because he had no invite. “This is the time I realised the man preaches water and takes wine. He took some of us to Las Vegas. This is a sin city headquarters of gambling and orgies. His choice baffled every one of us, because on landing, he put on the moral lenses,” the source said. In May this year, Mutua had a first-class ticket and a full six-star hotel booking to attend the world’s prestigious annual Cannes Film Festival. Unfortunately he never accessed any of the venue areas because he had not been invited. Last year, together with the then Culture and Arts CS, he attended the festival amid accusations of joyriding. Two Kenyan actors of ‘Neophobia’ film, which had been picked for screening, missed out on the event because of lack of facilitation. They accused Mutua of getting free trips off their work. In his defence, Mutua said: “I travel everyday in my own capacity as CEO of KFCB. I don’t need to have anybody’s film to travel. My travel just like other top government officials is cleared by State House, and you will never be cleared to go and joyride.” At the office, he is known as a headmaster, who polices any staff who seems to challenge him or have alternative viewpoints. “He is a know-it-all boss. His word is gospel. Those who don’t sing his songs are isolated and humiliated,” a staff said. ‘PROFESSIONALISED FILM’ In Mwaniki Mageria, the secretary general of Riverwood, Mutua has a supporter. One who believes Mutua is the right man for the job and who performed well. “Prior to his appointment, little or nothing was heard about film. But as the CEO, he elevated the discussions that have helped bring conversations on film to the national debate,” Mageria said. He helped enforce regulation in the film industry, setting out operation parameters. “Initially we worked in a free market, where everything goes. But his regulation has helped grow the sector by improving content quality, enabling us to compete effectively and professionalising the sector,” he said. Mageria said it was false to accuse Mutua of overstepping his mandate, saying if that was the case, then he could have been sued for it. “Our freedom of expression had started eroding our moral fabric. Popularity was slowly overtaking humanity, and some of us were aping or becoming so receptive to rogue or alien lifestyles away from how we were brought up,” Mageria said. “But someone had to remind us of our value system and call it out as it is, and that person was Mutua.” Mutua on his part said he has lived up to his job’s calling, performed beyond expectations and has no apologies for his actions. “I’d rather be accused of overzealousness than lethargy. I have raised the profile of KFCB. In just three years, everyone knows the organisation. I tripled its revenues from Sh88 million annually that I got when I came here. I have also built partnership across, whose value is way beyond Sh2 billion,” Mutua said. His stand on films, he said, is informed by the desire to have productions that promote values like historical heritage, hard work, honesty and a just society. “We are what we consume. If we allow the country to consume violence then we will remain a conflict-prone country,” he said. “If it’s easy life and shortcuts, then we will breed a society that depends on tokenisms and thrives on sponsor’s notion.”",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-10-12-we-are-what-we-consume-ezekiel-mutua-proud-as-tenure-ends/
219,True,False,0.0,ALPHONCE GARI @alphonce2011,13 November 2018 - 06:00,,Kilifi bears the brunt of teenage pregnancy crisis,,"Just the other day, as I was driving from Magarini to Malindi, I came a cross a candidate in her mid-to-late teens walking home from school. She was wearing a sweater to cover a protruding belly. The girl is among the thousands sitting the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination. She could deliver her newborn any time. She seemed unworried about the foetus she was carrying, or how the society perceived her as an soon-to-be mother who is still in school. In fact, she walked jovially to a waiting vehicle carrying passengers, probably to board it to her destination and wait for her next test paper the following day. Her case is just one of the thousands of teenage girls who fall victim to early pregnancy in the society. And Kilifi is at the heart of this crisis. The county shocked the nation after it was reported that 270 primary school girls are pregnant. Officials blamed it on high rates of poverty, illiteracy and defilement. Some village elders handle the cases in kangaroo courts. Culprits pay fines and allow the girl to be married off or even to abort the pregnancy. Latest statistics from the County Children’s Department indicate that over 13,000 girls between 15 and 19 are expecting babies in the county, while some, from as young as 14 years, have already given birth. Most of them end up dropping out of school to get married. “Every day there is at least one case of sexual offences against minors, and it is alarming,” a court official told the Star. “In the prisons, there are also many offenders convicted with cases of sexual abuse.” Read: DISCO MATANGA What is emerging from social debate and research, however, is that it is not always a case of girls being preyed on. Adolescents often have their first sexual encounter during disco matanga (funeral discos), otherwise known as disco vumbi or disco vugu vugu. These are dances held at night during funeral ceremonies. They run for seven nights as mourners fundraise for a dead person to meet burial expenses. Children who attend them usually go unaccompanied by their parents. This makes it easy for them to engage in early sex in the bush, informally referred to as ‘green lodges’. “The dances are held around areas where it is easy for these young persons to hide and have sex, mainly unprotected. Many girls get pregnant during this time,” a research by Plan International in 2016 reported. The county government banned disco matanga a few months ago, after it was alleged that they attract schoolgirls and lead to illicit sex. The discos have not been completely wiped out, but the authorities are recording a positive response. Some residents, however, criticised the ban, saying the root cause of teenage pregnancies is negligence by parents. They fail to play their role to bring up children with morals, critics say. In his report, county Children’s Officer George Migosi said out of the seven constituencies in the county, Kilifi North is leading with 3,134 pregnancies, followed by Magarini, which has 2,861cases, and Kaloleni with 2,180 cases. Migosi said Malindi and Kilifi South have 1,771 cases each, Ganze 1,362 and Rabai 545 cases. “There are another 290 girls between 10 and 14 years who were reported pregnant in the past one year,” he said. Migosi said many parents do not report such cases of teenage pregnancies, which is against the law. He said the department will soon arrest and prosecute parents who are irresponsible. Read: PREGNANCY TRAPS A research done in Kilifi county last year indicated that most girls lack Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) knowledge, and this was placed as the top contributor at 31 per cent. Girls’ love for money was ranked second at 28 per cent, followed by girls receiving favours from teachers, which was ranked at 18 per cent. Forced sex and rape was rated at 11 per cent. Availability of condoms was hardly seen as a contributing factor, with only 8 per cent blaming it. This can be attributed to the mass availability of free condoms all over the country up to grassroots level. The 2016 Plan International report cited the root causes of teenage pregnancies in Kilifi as cultural practices, poor parenting coupled with broken marriages, poverty and inadequate sex and family planning education. On cultural practices, the research touched deeply on the issue of funeral discos. It also cited long-held beliefs that girls’ work is to give birth in the society upon reaching puberty. The report noted that it is regarded as normal when a teenage girl gets pregnant before marriage. Some girls are exposed to drunkards at their homesteads, where mnazi (palm wine) business is done. This is more so in rural areas, where strict rules of establishing palm wine clubs away from home are not followed. Earlier this year, the Star learnt that many young girls in Magarini constituency, Kilifi county, engage in sex for financial favours to survive during their secondary education. Those vulnerable in the Magarini case study are the ones from poor families living in small rented single rooms, who at times cannot afford meals and other basic needs. During the tour of Adu, which is in the remotest part of Magarini, it emerged that young girls, who are mostly day scholars in the local public schools, become sex objects to get money for food, sanitary towels and even pocket money from boda boda operators. Most end up being lured to sex with older men in exchange for money, which not only puts them at risk of pregnancy but also of contaminating sexually transmitted diseases. Read: YOUTH SUMMIT In Kilifi South, an NGO has an awareness programme aimed at helping young girls raise their voices against the injustices. The NGO, called Rising Winners Youth Empowerment Initiative Mission, organises interaction sessions and youth summits to hear the plight of the adolescents. Attendees include youth living with HIV and Aids and orphans. At one summit in Kanamai, participants called on the authorities to state the plans they have to address the rising cases of gender-based violence, girl child protection and teenage pregnancies. For the first time, girls from five zones in the constituency publicly confessed to facing problems that call for intervention to enable them have equal rights to boys. Ninety five per cent of the 125 girls present in the summit were victims of GBV. They had confidence to raise their voices and face the authorities due to the trainings and education done by the Imarisha Msichana project. Top among the demands of the girls was to ask the county government to allocate sufficient funds in the budget for fighting GBV, and initiate programmes advocating the rights of the girl child. The girls shared shocking tales of their experiences, which could worsen the situation if no action is taken.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-11-13-kilifi-bears-the-brunt-of-teenage-pregnancy-crisis/
220,True,True,1.0,ALPHONCE GARI @alphonce2011,13 November 2018 - 06:00,,"Orphaned girl, 15, swaps sex for pads",,"As Kilifi grapples with being the face of the teenage pregnancy crisis in the nation, orphans are among the most vulnerable children. Sharon Nyadzua, 15, says since her parents’ death, she has been facing many problems from her grandmother, who cannot afford even to buy sanitary pads during her menstrual days. Speaking during an adolescents’ summit in Kanamai, Nyadzua admitted that at times she is forced to get into sexual relationships so as to get money for buying her basic needs. Due to awareness campaigns, she always uses protection when she needs to engage in sex. But she wishes she was not forced by circumstances to live that way. The summit was organised by Rising Winners Youth Empowerment Initiative Mission. Mission chair Doreen Maghanga says they are currently working with 125 adolescent girls from the constituency in five zones. The girls have been empowered and educated to know their rights in the society. She says they meet every Sunday with the young adolescents in their respective zones to exchange ideas and hear their voices. DSW sexual reproductive rights advocate Halima Ali Aba, a volunteer member of Imarisha Msichana project, says the adolescent summit was meant to bring girls to air their views on issues affecting them. Read: COUNTY INTERVENTION Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi recently told the Star the county government has plans to tackle GBV and teenage pregnancies. Through a policy document, it will educate the community on the importance of protecting the girl child. “Some parents in Kilifi cannot conformably include sanitary towels for their young ones if they go shopping. Such retrogressive cultures are outdated,” he said. Kingi says in Kilifi county, some parents could not freely talk to their girls on sexual matters, which makes it difficult for them to take fully responsibility. The governor has been instrumental in the fight for the rights of the girl child, though problems faced are more than the gains. In his ‘dream team’ cabinet of 10 executive members, five of them are women and are highly educated. The county is also blessed with high profile women, such as Aisha Jumwa, the current Malindi MP, who is an example of how a woman from a humble background can rise to become a national personality. Gender-based violence activists in Malindi say parents are to blame for the increased teenage pregnancies. Activist Helda Esliy says some parents would not question their daughter if she brought money home. In Magarini, Sauti ya Wanawake CEO Joyce Dama blames mothers for failing to take responsibility for their girls. “Most mothers in the rural areas of Magarini usually advise their daughters to visit ‘local medicine men’ for abortion after having sex with people to feed their family,” she says. Other girls, she says, are impregnated during social events, such as disco matanga and wedding dances.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-11-13-orphaned-girl-15-swaps-sex-for-pads/
221,True,True,7.0,Frank Muchugu @Frankie_newtonm,22 November 2018 - 00:15,,One in four women aborting calls for sincere dialogue,,"In Kenya, one in every four women has had an abortion. Another study shows that of the women who had severe complications after abortions, 45 per cent were teenagers. The estimates comprise those reported within the healthcare system, so the number could be much higher. An estimated 2,600 women die from unsafe abortions annually. This works out to an estimated seven women and girls dying every day, making unsafe abortions one of the major causes of maternal deaths in Kenya today. Kenya is currently facing an alarming public health crisis in the number of unsafe abortions that have remained unreported for the most part due to the attendant stigma and emotive nature of the abortion issue. Many women and girls in Kenya are losing their lives as they resort to unsafe abortion practices. Research shows young people living in urban slums are at significant risk of early unplanned pregnancies. A by the African Population and Health Research Centre in 2012 showed, for example, that in Nairobi’s urban slums, 116 out of every 1,000 girls between 15 and 19 had given birth. Half of these births were unplanned. And although 50 per cent of the 15- to 19-year-old women had started sexual activity, only 35 per cent were using any method of contraception. Safe abortions at clinics can cost about Sh20,000, whereas unsafe abortions are roughly a tenth of that price and payments can be made in instalments. It is not uncommon for household goods, such as televisions, to be included in those payments. SOCIAL STIGMA Adolescent sexual behaviour has been the subject of a number of recent discussions in the Kenyan media. These discussions have centred on declining moral standards, poor parenting, and a general “blame game” around who bears the responsibility for precocious sexual activity among Kenya’s young people. The social stigma around abortion and lack of service delivery policies is pushing women to resort to quacks (backstreet or untrained providers). Further to this, the legal provisions seem not to be fully understood. Unintended pregnancies are the main cause of unsafe abortions. The high number of unwanted pregnancies stems largely from the unmet need for family planning, which currently stands at 18 per cent. Lack of awareness and access to contraceptives and reproductive health services is also a contributing factor to the unmet need for family planning. Many women and young girls confronted with an unwanted pregnancy, in the face of a law that prohibits abortion on demand, put their lives in the hands of abortionists who use crude and unsterilised weapons. Both genders must also be able to access information about the most effective methods of contraception to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and the complications that arise from these procedures. While, therefore, legal, there was a lack of guidance which has meant that the circumstances in which abortion was permitted were uncertain. This uncertainty meant that there were three court cases every week where women were charged with having an illegal abortion, and studies showed that 10 out of 20 cases examined involved schoolgirls — some of whom were minors. The Health ministry put out guidelines in 2012 to help doctors determine whether they could legally perform an abortion, before withdrawing them in 2013 after a caustic backlash in this staunchly Christian country. Among other things, the 2012 guidelines outlined where, how, by whom and under which circumstance an abortion should be performed. Crucially, it also stated that mental health was included in the criteria of ‘health.’ After the retraction, the director of medical services wrote a memo to all health workers, directing them not to participate in safe abortion training. Every person, irrespective of age, has the right to access quality health services. As Kenya prepares a national response to implement the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, it must make substantial investments in sexual and reproductive health programmes. This will ensure every young woman is fully supported to make decisions that will ensure their sexual and reproductive health.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2018-11-22-one-in-four-women-aborting-calls-for-sincere-dialogue/

223,True,True,0.0,NJERI MBUGUA,23 April 2019 - 06:19,SEX OBJECT,Samburu morans give beads to bed little girls,• The practice is unique to the Samburu culture • It involves the moran selecting girlfriends for sexual activity by buying and giving them beads,"Nashami (not her real name) quietly sat outside her manyatta, watching as other children played, not daring to join them lest her co-wife sees her. She was wed to an already married middle-aged man when she was just nine years old. ""I was not allowed to play with the other children because I was a wife now and I would receive beatings from my co-wife if i did,"" she said. Before being given off as a bride, Nashami like many other girls her age had been 'booked' by a moran in a cultural practice referred to as beading. The practice, unique to the Samburu culture, involves the moran selecting girlfriends for sexual activity by buying and giving them beads. Like Nashami, other girls who have not undergone female genital mutilation are eligible for beading by the moran aged between 15 and 35 years. ""There is no sure way to estimate exact ages because most of the people do not know which year they were born,"" Jeremiah Kipainoi, who works at the Samburu Girls Foundation, said. ""The men are allowed to engage in sexual activities with the girls, and sometimes they wait for the girls to grow up a little more if they bead very young girls."" HANDED OVER BY OWN MOTHER The process begins after a moran gains interest in a young girl and goes for negotiations with the girl's mother and brothers, who are often morans. ""The relationship is purely sexual and is not aimed for marriage. This is because beading occurs among clan members,"" Kipainoi said. Should a girl fall pregnant during her beading period, she either undergoes a traditional abortion, gives up the newborn for infanticide or for adoption into another ethnic community. Their relationship is terminated when either the moran or the girl gets married. ""Once the family decides a girl is ready for marriage, she is cut the day before her marriage ceremony, and the moran is at liberty to look for another 'girlfriend',"" Kipainoi said. However, once the moran acquires a bride, he ceases to hold his warrior status and is considered a junior elder. ""Junior elders are not allowed to engage in beading,"" Kipainoi told the Star. While the cultural practices may seem unorthodox, they are considered normal among the Samburu people. ""They have done these practices for ages and it is hard to simply move on from it because we tell them it's wrong,"" he said. When the young girls are old enough, they join the moran in singing traditional songs and in the midst of it, come to 'agreements'. ""The parents consent to the practice and in some cases, the girls make plans with the morans to bead them. There are however rare cases where the girls are forced into relationships with these men,"" Kipainoi said. SEXUAL TRAUMA Speaking to the Star on phone, Dr Allan Adungo, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Kenyatta National Hospital, said the health implications on the young girls are both psychological and physical. ""They are babies and should not be having intercourse. It is a traumatic experience because they are not prepared for intercourse at all at that time,"" he said. Other than psychological trauma, the girls may also experience trauma around the genitalia because their bodies are not mature for intercourse. Ikol says the trauma may affect them later in life because they may be disinterested in intercourse when they grow up and are at high risk of developing cancer. ""When you engage in sex early in life, there is always the risk of cancer development because the cervix is not mature enough,"" he said. There is also a high HIV prevalence among the Samburu youth practising beading because the morans are not limited to a single sexual partner. They also do not necessarily practise safe sex options. A strategic plan report by the county government shows the county has a HIV prevalence rate of 5 per cent against a population of 274,079. ""This means there are an estimated 13,073 HIV victims, of which only 6,883 know their status, leaving over 6,190 victims who do not know their HIV status,"" the report reads. The report further indicates a low condom uptake among men, meaning that even with multiple partners, unsafe sex is still highly practised. Women have been reported to resort to using female condoms disbursed as beauty hand ornaments, despite low supply. Other factors, such as limited access to reproductive health awareness and reduced empowerment also increase chances of transmission. The health of these girls is further put at risk when they are 'cut' in preparation for marriage. ""There are different degrees of the cut that have different health implications. Those practising may develop problems with urination or develop persistent pain around the genitalia, which makes it difficult to engage in intercourse later in life. Child birth also becomes a problem because the birth canal is narrow,"" he said. In cases where the girl experiences a tear around the birth canal, she is put at risk of developing recto-vaginal fistula, where stool is passed from the birth canal. The treatment options available to these girls depend on the degree of the damage caused. Due to the age group, after rescue, the girls are examined under anesthesia to assess the degree of the injuries incurred. ""If there are any injuries we can repair, we perform corrective surgery. We also subject them to counselling and try and find safe homes for them,"" he said. POLITICAL RESISTANCE Through the help of the foundation, Nashami was rescued and her husband was arrested and detained. However, a female politician bailed him out of jail. ""Politicians do not publicly shun these practices because that has no political gain for them. They know that if they are backed by clans, then they will get the votes,"" Kipainoi said. The foundation, which currently hosts over 300 girls, says they are faced with constant political resistance, which makes it harder to fight for equal rights for the girls. During a recent discussion on FGM, several survivors of early marriage and FGM accused the local woman representative of supporting these practices. ""We do not enjoy political support from our leaders and because of this we have constant security threats at the foundation,"" one of them said. ""Some local leaders will publicly deny the existence of these practices, yet they infringe on many of our rights."" Kipainoi says while some politicians offer support, such as food supplies, they do not want to publicly be involved with the fight against these practices. ""We have had some who are outrightly saying the organisation is not legitimate. With a big percentage of the population already illiterate, the leaders make the fight harder by not educating them on these issues,"" he said. ""While beading is widely accepted by these communities, there is no denying that it is defilement because the girls are underage."" According to the constitution, the age of consent for sexual intercourse is 18 years and sexual activity with anyone under the age of 18 is considered an offence. ""The law is already in place but the government has not taken effective action against these communities. The incentives they provide to assisting organisations can only do so much,"" Kipainoi said. He called upon government authorities to take more aggressive action against people who indulge in the infringement of children's rights. Human rights activist Florence Kanyua, while strongly condemning the practices, encouraged education of the children while they are at a young age. ""We need to educate them on their rights because if they are aware, they may recognise when those rights are being violated and take action,"" she said. Kipainoi said several organisations had began holding under-the-tree meetings with the morans to raise awareness because they are the group heavily involved in beading. ""The women do not have much say in such matters, while the elders do not really care. So we have resorted to talking to the morans because they are in a better position to take action,"" he said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2019-04-23-samburu-morans-give-beads-to-bed-little-girls/
224,True,False,0.0,[],22 May 2019 - 06:00,HYDROCEPHALUS DEMYSTIFIED,Saving Baby Joshua: Mother’s search for brain swelling cure,• The enlargening can be managed by draining of cerebral spinal fluid. • 70 per cent of patients suffering from hydrocephalus heal.,"When women give birth to a child with deformities, they get stressed and end up grappling with unanswered questions, since some communities believe the women must be cursed. In some African traditions, men are forced to marry another wife, while the mother with a deformed child is divorced or kept in a separate house. However, medics say some conditions facing little babies are not brought about by a curse. One of them is hydrocephalus, which confounds many women, families and the society whenever a child develops the condition. Paediatric neurosurgeon Dr Martin Muthinja from AIC Kijabe Hospital says hydrocephalus entails an abnormal buildup of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the cavities of the brain. CSF protects the brain as a shock absorber, supplies it nutrients such as oxygen, and also removes waste from it. Too much of CSF causes the head to steadily grow in size. It could lead to convulsions and at times damages the brain. Dr Muthinja says the condition affects children, adding that it is noticed before or after the child is born. MOTHER'S SHOCK Cynthia Muchiri is a mother of two who works as a civil servant in Nairobi. She learnt her son had started showing signs of hydrocephalus condition when she was 32 weeks expectant. Cynthia says she did several scans in different hospitals, hoping to hear a different verdict, and she started wondering what would happen to her baby. “At one of the hospitals I visited, a doctor told me after the scan that children with such deformities need to be aborted, but I declined since the pregnancy had grown and I knew it was wrong before the eyes of God,” she said. “I used to encourage myself that children are gifts from God and we should not abort them. I prayed a lot, asking God to give me the strength to get a good and healthy baby than the one each doctor was telling me I was carrying.” Cynthia later developed labour pains and was taken to MP Shah Hospital in Nairobi, where she was blessed with a boy through caesarian section and named him Joshua Muchiri. “The baby had a hole in the spine and curved arms and legs. He was brought to my maternity bed and I breastfed him. I couldn’t believe he was the one. At one time, I asked nurses to take him away. I was so stressed, I cried and prayed to God,” she said. Joshua was taken to theatre and the hole was covered. However, he later developed hydrocephalus. 7 SURGERIES IN 2 WEEKS Cynthia says the now one year and eight months old boy underwent seven surgeries in two weeks in a bid to control the hydrocephalus. She started looking for a hospital where she could be taking her son to so as to control the condition, which disturbs him and her. “I asked God to help me accept the condition of my baby so I could help my family accept my son. Mothers with children like mine need to be shown love, acceptance and be given hope,” she said, adding that her family has been supportive. “I’ve met with women who claim they were sidelined by their people due to getting such children. These issues are there, and people really need to be informed that it is not someone’s wish to get such a child.” Cynthia now takes Joshua for a checkup and draining of the CSF at AIC Kijabe Hospital. Before coming there, she had spent more than Sh1.5 million looking for treatment. However, at Kijabe, she was referred to Bethany Kid’s Hospital, a special section for the children. Cynthia told them she was looking for help because she did not have money. “When they learnt the challenge I had and the condition my son was in, my son was quickly admitted and treatment started. I was busy telling them I do not have money to pay for those services, but they told me not to worry,” she said, speaking at the facility. “What also shocked me is that they first prayed for him and counselled me, something I had never seen before. Both the doctors and nurses are so caring.” Dr Muthinja says they handle close to 60 cases of hydrocephalus conditions every Tuesday, when they hold clinics at the facility. “We hold a special clinic for patients suffering from hydrocephalus and spina bifida condition every week. Spina bifida is a defect that develops at birth, where the spinal cord fails to develop properly. At times, it causes a baby to develop hydrocephalus,” he said. TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT Neurosurgery head at the hospital Dr Kim Steffan says hydrocephalus is treated through surgical procedures called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy/ Choroid Plexus Cauterisation (ETV/CPC). The ETV method is where a doctor creates an opening to drain off the unnecessary CSF. Dr Steffan says 70 per cent of patients suffering from hydrocephalus heal, saying they need management such as visiting hospitals for CSF draining. Patients start speaking well, walking, eating and their head sizes reduce, he says. Children are the most affected since they do not tell what they feel. The neurosurgeon urged parents to be very cautious with the changes they notice in their babies every day. He says hydrocephalus symptoms include increased head circumference, sunsetting eyes, veins on the head, separated skull bones and at times, vomiting and shivering. Some parents come to the hospital to seek help over the symptoms, without knowing the real condition affecting their children. Dr Muthinja says disease is commonly reported in many countries in Africa and Asia, adding that not much study has been done about the disease in Africa. However, the Health ministry indicates that 124 children are born per hour in the country, whose population stands at over 52 million people, and an estimated 1,000 children are born with the condition every year. The major hospitals dealing with the condition in the country include Kijabe, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Coast General Hospital and Kenyatta National Hospital, where 25 paediatric neurosurgeons who treat the conditions are posted.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2019-05-22-saving-baby-joshua-mothers-search-for-brain-swelling-cure/
225,True,False,0.0,[],31 May 2019 - 06:00,WILL WE EVER SEE THE GREEN CITY IN THE SUN?,Is Nairobi River clean-up another mission impossible?,"• Restoring the Nairobi River to pristine status appears to be a mirage. • The clean-up of the river turns up corpses, aborted foetuses and medical waste. Then there's raw sewage and industrial effluent.Workers are given jabs against hepatitis B.","At first it was garbage, dead pigs, cats and dogs. Then Nairobi River cleaners found human foetuses and other corpses. So far, 14 bodies of adults, children and foetuses have been retrieved. Seven of the bodies were found near the Korokocho slums. ""When we found the first body, we reported at Kariobangi police station. The police said it cannot be taken to mortuary as it was too small,"" said Fredrick Okinda, head of Komb-Green Solutions who leads the clean-up in the area. Once a body is found, cleaners hold a short ceremony and take it to the mortuary where it naturally remains unclaimed and is disposed of. ""Clinics in the area are the main sources of aborted foetuses,"" he said. Clinics also dispose of dangerous syringes and hazardous medical waste. This is dangerous but cleaners continue working. ""Poverty is what pushes us to clean the river. If we had money, we would not be doing this,"" cleaner Moses Muchina, 21, said. It's better to clean the river and earn a little money instead of clashing with the police, he said. ""It is dangerous but we try our best. God has helped us,"" Lydia Wambui, 31, said. The Nairobi River water, all the way from Lavington to Dandora, was clean and sparkling a few decades ago. It abounded with fish, water beetles, dragon flies and other creatures. Today, the Nairobi River is dead, or nearly so. It doesn't support life, except for scum and maggots. The problem is enormous and despite teams of workers, it isn't getting much better. Officials tasked with transforming Nairobi City are finding it daunting. On April 13 last year, the Nairobi Regeneration team visited President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. They promised to enhance services and clean up the city and river in 30 days, make Nairobi the Green City in the Sun again. A fantasy. Members were to launch a mortgage refinancing company and clear garbage in the 85 wards in a month. The team of national and county leaders is co-chaired by Governor Mike Sonko and Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala. Some bosses had never visited slums and only saw them on television in their upmarket homes. Confronted by the extent of river pollution, some were overwhelmed and discouraged. In March, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko said lack of funds was putting the ambitious plan at risk since only Sh110 million had been allocated. Supremacy battles and mistrust among agencies have also undermined the ambitious programme. But on May 15, the team made another spirited clean-up effort at Korogocho market, one of the major river pollution points. Regeneration also focusses on housing and settlements, infrastructure and transport, energy, water resources, environment and solid waste, youth, women and persons living with a disability. Other sectors are land and ICT. City Hall has allocated Sh330 million to the programme in a supplementary budget to fix Nairobi Eastlands roads and projects such as cleaning the Nairobi River. Since the project started, several buildings on riparian land have been demolished. About 4,000 structures in slums have been targeted to demolition and 120,000 people are supposed to be relocated. I ndustrial waste and untreated sewage from slums are still polluting the river. Nema has closed more than 20 factories in Industrial Area for discharging effluent. Closure is part of the 100-day countrywide rapid results initiative. National Environment Management Authority director general Geoffrey Wahungu said the major problem is that sewer lines were built long ago when the population was about one million. Now it’s four million. “People in these informal settlements are sitting on way leaves for sewer lines,” Wahungu said. Nema wants the slum problem addressed. On May 15, City Hall and Nema officials confronted the reality of the river. They found a fresh grave of two children in Korogocho just beside the water. Cleaners had discovered them. There were four more graves next to the river. ""We buried twins in one grave four days ago. So far, we have found six children dumped in the river,"" Moses Muchina said. He leads the cleaning group of ore than 60 former delinquents and criminals mainly from Korogocho. It has 150,000 to 200,000 people living in 1.5 square kilometres. It’s known for crime, drugs and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and widespread HIV/Aids. At the Korogocho market, there’s a huge heap of organic waste that seeps into the river. The Nairobi Water and Sewerage company is among firms discharging raw sewage. The company has been served with a restoration order. A pre-treatment plant is said to be non-operational. “It should be made to work immediately,” Nema board chairman John Konchellah said. Nairobi Environment CEC for Environment Vesca Kangongo said organic waste from Korogocho market will be turned into fertiliser. ""We have collected over 200 lorry-loads of garbage,"" she said. “Compost manure can be used to beautify Nairobi."" The CEC said Ngong and Mathare rivers will also be cleaned. The county has allocated Sh400 million in the next financial year for the job. ""We will not allow pollution of the Thwake dam project into which Nairobi River water will be discharged,” Kangongo said. The dam is being built at the border of Kitui and Makueni counties. Nairobi River is a tributary of River Athi, the main source of water for the dam. Kangongo warned garbage collectors not to pollute rivers. ""Stern action will be taken against any private garbage collector found dumping solid waste next to a river or by the roadside,” she said. Workers involved in the clean-up will be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Wahungu also said several people have been arrested in connection with factory discharge. Other problems are contradictory laws covering wetlands and riparian lands. It’s easy for developers to encroach and circumvent the laws that set different limits for construction near rivers. The laws are to be rewritten. Past clean-ups have failed. The future of the Nairobi River is far from clear, like the water itself. FACT BOX OTHER FAILED CLEAN-UPS • 2001-03 clean-up efforts failed. • March 2004, restoration of Nairobi Dam was launched by government, Unep, UN-Habitat.

226,True,True,4.0,[],22 July 2019 - 06:00,NOT READY TO BE A MOTHER,Painful relief: When girls resort to abortion,"• The hours before an abortion can be nerve-racking, confusing, sad and depressing • The aftermath is often characterised by trauma. Some vow to never have sex again","Unprotected sex. Unwanted pregnancy. Unbearable consequences. ""Story of my life,"" girls who've walked this lonely road would say. Desperate times, desperate measures. Akinyi* (not her real name), 23, had first opted to visit Marie Stopes Clinic to confirm her pregnancy and see if she could have the procedure done there. She found out she was pregnant on her boyfriend's birthday last year and had the abortion just two days later. ""They were charging Sh5,500 for the abortion service and I did not have that much money at the time. Neither did my boyfriend,"" she says. She had been suspecting she was pregnant and even joked with her boyfriend about it. The couple had been having sex without protection since they met the preceding year. ""I had decided it was okay if we did not use protection. We had gotten a pregnancy scare once and I remember none of us even knew how to take a pregnancy test,"" she says, adding that t hey used 'alternative' means that sometimes included contraception. The day she found out she was pregnant, Akinyi was coming back from a job interview when she came across a chemist. ""My suspicions were growing because I had begun to feel tired all the time and it's not the normal kind of tired; I felt like I had been working the mines for hours on end,"" she says. ""It was different, extreme, I just knew."" Akinyi got home and took the test, which came back positive. Not believing what she saw, she used the other two strips she had bought. ""The panic attack began when the third one came back positive. I had actually been laughing after the first one tested positive but suddenly couldn't breathe after the third strip showed two lines,"" she says. "" I was shaking, my chest was heavy and I couldn't talk. I was alone because my boyfriend had left town for a work assignment and I had not told any of my friends yet. "" After getting through the panic attack, she began to cry because she knew she had to abort the pregnancy. ""My father had warned me. He had told me straight to my face that if I ever let myself get pregnant, his home is not one of the places I should go,"" she says. Devastated, alone and confused, Akinyi decided to call her boyfriend and tell him what had happened. ""I had contemplated not telling him that day because it was his birthday but the longer I kept it, the worse I felt. I called him a few hours later and told him. His first question was whether I was going to abort,"" she says. Akinyi understood where he was coming from because he had made it clear he was not ready to have children. Raising the child on her own was not an option for Akinyi. Asked why, she said, ""I had seen my friends keep theirs and I was not that strong. I was not ready."" THREE PILLS, ONE EMERGENCY The instructions were simple: three pills — one in the mouth, one in the genitalia and the third was, 'just in case.' ""I got the pills from my boyfriend's sister's friend. My boyfriend paid Sh2,000 for them. I bought fruits on my way home because I was not planning on leaving my house at all that weekend,"" she says. She describes the hours before the abortion as nerve-racking, confusing, sad and extremely depressing. ""There is something my mind has completely blocked from that day. Sections of that night that I don't let myself remember,"" she says. She took the pills, as instructed, at 9pm that Saturday and began to wait. At first, she thought she had done something wrong because nothing was happening. ""When the first jab of pain hit me, it was like the medicine was tearing through my uterus, the pain intensifying when it was time to pass a clot. It hurt. Badly,"" she said. At one point, she began to feel movement in her uterus, and this was the most painful part yet. ""It was so much, for like half an hour, all I could do was cry and try not to scream because it was now around midnight. Sometimes I had to go the washroom and just sit there and bleed because of how intense it got,"" she says. When the 'movement' was over, Akinyi passed her biggest clot yet before the pain subsided. ""After I couldn't sleep or eat, and I smoked marijuana and ate fruits for a week straight. I think I was traumatised because all I did was remember the pain and cry,"" she says. ""I drastically lost weight and it was very noticeable, so I told people the stress of graduation had gotten to me."" Akinyi and her boyfriend never talked about what happened because she says he will never understand what she went through. ""I was about a month along and I only talk to my best friend about it because she has gone through something similar,"" she said. For Angela*, also 23, a few minutes after taking the second batch of pills, she was experiencing diarrhoea, vomiting, sweating and shivering. She was sitting in her studio apartment, staring at the wall with pregnancy test in hand, and swearing. ""I made a pact with myself that I would never have sex again. I was done with the male species,"" Angela said. Even before she took the test, Angela knew she was pregnant. ""I was not scared, I was not crying. I was sure I was pregnant and I was sure I wanted out. But the one thing that got me scared was the fact that I was alone,"" she said. ""I had been having unprotected sex and decided I did not want to have children, at least not until I was ready mentally, financially and emotionally."" However, she did not have the finances needed to procure a safe abortion, and the man she had gotten pregnant by had expressed interest in fathering a child. ""I had to ask the guy for money, something I didn't want to do because I feared his reaction. He wanted to have a child but to be honest, I had already made my decision,"" she said. After a week of ignoring the situation, Angela says he finally gave her the money she needed for the abortion. ""I went to the nearest Marie Stopes I could find, and after the tests were done. I was given a pill there and carried four others I was to take the next day,"" she said. A few minutes after taking the second batch, the 'horror' started. ""Then the bleeding started and I will never forget the amount of pain I was in. I thought I was going to die. Sleep was out of the question that night. I just lay there feeling the life coming out of my body,"" she said. She finally drifted off to sleep at around 4am and was up by 7am the next morning. ""I still had to cook, shower, put makeup on and go to work, acting like everything was fine. And life continued from there,"" Angela said. QUICK AND PAINLESS Joan*, 24, had it easy. ""I barely felt anything after the process had been completed, and it was not even that expensive,"" she said. This was the second time she was procuring an abortion, and she had found a doctor who made the process easy. ""For Sh4,500, they will inject you with a drug that puts you to sleep. And then you wake up when the whole process is complete,"" she said. ""I am yet to experience any side-effects from the process, and I would highly recommend it."" However, for Emily*, also 24, the process would have consequences that haunt her to date. She found out she was pregnant two years ago by a man who not only rejected the pregnancy but also abandoned her thereafter. ""He broke up with me and blocked me on his phone after I told him I was pregnant,"" she said. Emily, a campus student, could not keep the baby because she was not ready and did not have the finances to manage. ""My parents have worked really hard to get me to this level of education, and I just did not want to let them down like that,"" she said. Frustrated and desperate for a solution, Emily found a 'doctor' at Githurai who was willing to help. When she finally raised the Sh1,800 he asked for, they set up an appointment and headed to the facility. ""It was 10 minutes of excruciating pain, I could not believe it. They inserted something into my genitalia and started the process,"" Emily said. The doctor offered her some medication that would help with the pain before starting to 'clean' her womb with some surgical tools. ""Afterwards I had the worst cramps and could barely walk, but I was lucky because my cousin was with me and she took me home,"" she said. A month later during her period, Emily started having back pains and cramps that would leave her bedridden. ""I consulted a different doctor, who told me that in the process of 'cleaning' my womb, one of my kidneys had been moved hence the pain,"" she said. ""I cannot tell my mother the problem because I am not ready for her to find out. So to manage the pain, I use painkillers."" SEEK RIGHT INFO Centre for Reproductive Rights senior legal adviser Martin Onyango says young women and girls fail to seek the right services. ""The right information is not available for those who need it. That is why most end up in the hands of quacks, who are not trained and are operating in unlicensed facilities,"" he said. Onyango said post-abortion care is constitutional and available in all health services. He added women and girls need to be equipped with the information on who else, apart from public health facilities, is qualified to offer the services. Last month, a five-judge bench declined to give a blanket ruling making abortion legal in Kenya. However, the constitution allows a window for abortion. Article 26 (4) of the Constitution states, ""Abortion is permitted if, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is a need for emergency treatment or the life or health of the mother is in danger or if permitted by any other written law.""

227,True,True,12.0,NJERI MBUGUA MbuguaENjeri,22 July 2019 - 04:00,NO JUDGMENT,Professional aftercare crucial to avoid stigma,"• Professional help is the best because there is no judgment involved • Effects of abortion are emotional, social and cognitive","Dr Silas Kirinya, a psychiatrist, advises young women who have undergone an abortion procedure to seek professional help. ""Professional help is the best place to get support after abortion since one might be judged by spiritual leaders, friends or family members,"" he said. ""A professional therapist is non-judgmental and should be able to support a survivor of abortion according to their unique particular needs."" He advises those who are believers to seek spiritual healing, which helps them deal with inner wounds caused by past painful emotional events. Kirinya, who has a counselling centre at Jkuat towers, says they have witnessed many women recover and go back to their families with the hope of a better life. ""At Amazon, we have helped so many young women who have procured an abortion, and the healing process is oftentimes a beautiful thing,"" he said. According to the psychiatrist, the controversy behind abortion is majorly a question of morality because abortion involves loss of life which defies morality. However, whether it's wrong or right, legal or illegal, permissible or not, the aftermath of abortion is always experienced by its survivors. ""Morality, as we know, has myriads of schools of thoughts, each trying to universalise their tenets. But all these arguments for or against abortion oftentimes do not consider its effects on the survivors,"" he said. REASONS AND EFFECTS Kirinya says the reasons for abortion are sometimes not dire. ""At times the reason is as subtle as, 'I have found a new boyfriend who looks better, hence I cannot carry the baby of my ex,'"" he said. Once the process is over, however, an impact, usually negative, will be left with the woman or girl. ""The aftermath of abortion does not only affect the emotional well-being of a survivor but also their social, cognitive, physical and spiritual well-beings,"" he said. For instance, emotionally, it can cause fear, anxiety, anger, irritability, mood swings, depressive episodes, panic attacks and anxiety attacks. Cognitive effects include excessive thoughts of guilt, intrusive thoughts, low concentration, loss of memory among others form of thoughts, thoughts of suicide or even at times succeeding in committing suicide. ""With such cognitive distortion, one can even easily cause injury or accident to oneself or others,"" he said. Socially, depression after an abortion may lead to isolation from other people, especially if they know about the abortion. ""One of the key social issues we have noticed with survivors of abortion is that they do not what to hear the voice of a crying baby, or at times they hate to see a pregnant woman,"" he said. The psychiatrist adds social events, such as baby showers, will further isolate a woman who has aborted because of the sense of guilt. ""They may not want to meet people because to them it feels like everyone knows what they have done and people are likely to condemn them,"" he said. Other impacts of abortion are low self-esteem and lack of confidence. Last month, the court ruled illegal the move by the director of medical services to withdraw the 2012 standards and guidelines and training curriculum for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion. The court said since the guidelines were public policy documents passed through a process involving public participation, the withdrawal should have followed the same procedure.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2019-07-22-professional-aftercare-crucial-to-avoid-stigma/
228,True,True,0.0,[],27 August 2019 - 05:00,VICIOUS CYCLE,Triumphs and tragedies of women in Kibagare slum,• Husbands who discover their wives are HIV-positive have resorted to stealing their ARVs because of stigma. • Police have been accused of taking bribes from illegal chang'aa dens to allow the businesses to operate.,"Like in many slums, women from Kibagare have to overcome a host of challenges in their lives. These include drugs, alcohol, abortion, poverty, injustice and crime. Finding Sarah* (not real name) passed out in a ditch every morning was not uncommon after nights of partying hard. ""Ask everyone here they know. I would drink chang'aa in these dens you see outside and wake up in ditches to continue,"" she said. Her daily escapades were made worse by the fact that she did not have a job or anything productive to do. ""When you have nothing else to do here, the environment around you will consume you whole, and you will start doing what everyone else is doing,"" she adds. Located in Kitusuru location, Kibagare village was established by coffee plantation workers, who laboured on the colonial farm currently known as Loresho estate. Before leaving, the farm owners sold the land to private individuals, who did not need the service of the workers. The slum is estimated to be home to more than 15,000 people. Entrance is via a tarmacked road through the Loresho estate, manned by security guards from end to end. Visitors are regularly warned by the guards to be careful as they approach the village because of the rampant insecurity. COPS COLLECTING BRIBES Beyond the Loresho gate, the road is narrow and dusty, with iron sheet structures on either end and an assortment of people, motorbikes, businesses and vehicles all vying for space. The businesses are mostly retail shops, video shops, grocery kiosks and drinking dens. The men sit on their motorbikes in small groups, chatting and staring. Janice* is one of the business owners who run a small food kiosk with help from her son. ""The police car you saw as you came in was doing rounds, collecting small dues from the chang'aa dens so they are allowed to keep operating,"" she said. Janice leads the Star to a hall where she and 20 other women hold their regular meetings. The women are reformed alcoholics and small business owners who meet for seminars and table banking. Although initially reluctant to speak, the women later paint a picture of uncertainty, desperation and hope. They are tailors, grocery sellers, food hawkers, shop owners and hotel owners. Their biggest challenge has been finding a sustainable market. ""We have made clothes, baskets that remain in our houses because we have no one to sell them to and our tomatoes are rotting in the kiosks because no one is buying them,"" Mary* said. Before interventions from the Young Women Campaign Against Aids, the women would join men to drink chang'aa making them unable to work or take care of their children. LAND DISPUTE Maurice Ouko, programme officer at YWCAA said they started the programme in 2006. ""The women were very reluctant at first and would occasionally ask for some chang'aa before accepting to listen to us,"" he said. Over time, as the organisation gained their trust, they began holding seminars and workshops to train the women on skills such as tailoring and banking. Mary says they were encouraged to start small savings in groups and, after a while, give the money to one of the members for business. ""After that, we would save again and help another woman start a business,"" she said. The organisation also chipped in to help the women with small loans. ""They were very reluctant to take large sums of money because they did not have any jobs that would guarantee they could pay the money back,"" Maurice said. The firm changed tactic and offered the women Sh200 for periods of between six months to a year. ""With 200, they accepted because six months to a year was ample time to refund the money,"" he said. Over time, the loans graduated from between Sh500 to Sh1,000. ""We revised our loan system to encourage more women to take up money and told them that the sooner they paid, the sooner they got a top-up,"" he said. ""Soon, we were giving the women loans of up to Sh100,000 for up to a year."" Things had begun looking up for the women until a dispute over a piece of land threatened their homes and businesses. The dispute arose with neighbouring Nairobi School after they claimed the residents were encouraging drug behaviour among students, who would escape school to the slum area. ""Since they started saying we were on their land, people were running away from the village and then we had no one to buy our products,"" Mary said. Wanja* says she was born and raised in the area and her parents still live there. ""This has been our home since 1959. For more than 60 years, where have they been? Former President Jomo Kenyatta told them not to remove us from here and we have been living here in peace until they came,"" she said. In 2016, Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi asked the Land Commission to give title deeds to residents of the slum. The land dispute case is currently in court. LIVING POSITIVE Sarah began attending seminars by the YWCAA and during that process, she found out she was pregnant and HIV-positive. She admits it was hard to decide to keep the pregnancy and at one point, thought about terminating it. However, with the information from the Aids campaigners, she got she was able to carry the pregnancy to full term and gave birth to a healthy girl. She is currently a mother of four. "" The seminars helped me because I was able to accept myself and started living as an openly HIV-positive woman,"" she said. ""If not for the seminars, I would have kept living the same life, not realising there was a better way to live."" However, most of the other women who found out they had contracted the virus lost hope. ""They started having multiple sexual partners because they said if they were going to die, they would take as many as possible to the grave with them."" To keep herself busy and fend for her child, she started a nursery school. The only teacher at her school, she has to send the children home when it is time for her to go to the clinic for her medicine. They receive free anti-retroviral medication. However, while she has managed to transform her life, most parents who bring children to her school are still sleeping in ditches, unemployed and evading responsibility. ""Most of them do not have food. Wanja prepares porridge for us at 10am, but by lunchtime, they are very hungry because the porridge does very little for them,"" Sarah said. Sarah takes the children through potty training and basic reading skills before they are enrolled in formal primary school. ""I saw this was better than doing nothing and spending all day thinking about the problems of this village,"" she said. She is also chairwoman of an HIV support group for women living with the virus. Despite openly living with the virus, the stigma surrounding people with HIV is still high. Most of the women will not even talk about the subject and have stopped taking their medication because they do not want to be the village laughing stock. ""Here in the village, defaulters are the ones dying at alarming rates because of opportunistic diseases,"" Sarah said. Afraid to get tested and have people find out, husbands who discover their wives are living with the virus have resorted to stealing the drugs from their women. HELL ON EARTH They all agree on one thing - the village is not safe. From alcoholism, petty theft, abortions, defilement, inappropriate sexual conduct, insecurity and corruption, the women of the village say they have been through it all. The women say young men are impregnating and dumping girls who have resorted to aborting and dumping the fetuses in the nearby river. ""The other day, a four-year-old from my school was defiled, the parents are not paying attention. If I took you down to the river, we would see bodies dumped there by these young girls who choose to abort. It's all very sad,"" she said. Drugs and alcohol have also stolen their children but they cannot turn to the police, whom they claim are part of the problem. They claim the alcohol comes from neighbouring Uganda, and police warn owners before they raid the places. It sold in sachets that can be as low as Sh30. ""They come here mostly on Saturday and Sunday to collect bribes from chang'aa dens. You told us that you met a Landrover on the way here — that is exactly what they were doing,"" one of the women interjected. The women are afraid to report any of these problems to the police because they fear retribution that would compromise their already fragile sense of safety. ""If you are attacked and you report it to the police and say you know the perpetrator, they will arrest him but if they are given a bribe, you can be sure they will be let him go,"" Mary said. ""Now what do you think that person will do to you? They will come after you and maybe even kill you. We have no one, not even the chief, to turn to."" They claim children have resorted to petty crime because they never got a chance at education, and are being shot dead by police trying to steal in high-end areas, such as Westlands. Gigiri police boss Richard Mungwai denied the claims, saying the police have worked to eradicate the chang'aa problem. ""I have been in constant talks with the chief and Loresho OCPD and I can say for sure the problem has been dealt with unless it started yesterday night or today. There is no chang'aa in Kibagare,"" he said. The police boss added sometimes residents will say anything to paint the police in bad light. SODOM AND GOMORRAH Monica*, an elderly woman living alone in Kibagare, detailed to the Star how she had to endure sexual activity outside her house from two drunk men. ""There is a pole outside my house and that is a commonplace they come to have sex. Like yesterday two drunk men found their way there. I had to remain silent, not even daring to cough in case they decide to come after me,"" she said. ""We barely sleep because of the drinking dens with loud music playing all night long. Every day in the morning, we wake up to find condoms all over the place. Our children take them, thinking they are balloons, which places them in grave danger."" Women who are physically abused are silent because they are embarrassed and would be the talk of the town if other people found out. ""We are used to it here because where do we go? When a woman is beaten in the village, she will leave for a few days but they always go back because there is no way to go,"" Mary said. They claim that men are also emotionally abusive and refuse to take any responsibility. ""They are now chasing after old women because they do not want to work. They want to have a place where their sexual needs are met while they sit on the sofa all day,"" Wanja said. Monica says a man had offered to pay her house rent in exchange for ""a place to sleep when he comes home from the club"". They want the government to eradicate drugs and illicit alcohol from the village. ""If they eliminate these elements, other things will improve. Our children need rehabilitation because they are completely lost. We have no money because our jobs are failing,"" Janice said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/big-read/2019-08-27-triumphs-and-tragedies-of-women-in-kibagare-slum/

A number of legislators from the affected constituencies are apprehensive the posts would be scrapped should they be found ineligible. Part of the effort is to rally residents to declare that they come from the said regions no matter where they will be counted during the national census slated for August 24. Mobilization campaigns have gained momentum in Mt Kenya, North Eastern, and Coast with the leaders asking residents to save the constituencies. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this morning. Kibaki used and dumped me: Karua Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua fought for retired President Mwai Kibaki during the disputed 2007 elections only to be undermined by his administration later.

236,True,True,4.0,The Conversation,18 March 2018 - 15:00,,Kenya paying heavy human and financial cost for unsafe abortions,,"One of the critical targets for countries that are trying to meet the sustainable development goals is reducing the number of mothers who die from complications during or immediately after their pregnancies. The is that each country will have less than 70 mothers dying for each of the 100 000 live births that happen each year. This would eliminate almost all preventable maternal deaths. In Kenya, this is still a challenge. Every year . One of the major contributors to this figure are the complications that women sustain during unsafe abortions. Unsafe abortions happen when a pregnancy is terminated by someone who lacks the necessary skills and in places that aren’t medically certified. In Kenya, abortion is only legal when there is a need for emergency treatment or the life or health of the mother is in danger. Permission for an abortion must be made by a trained health professional. The latest data for Kenya (from 2012) shows that there were unsafe abortions in the country that year. At least 100 000 of those women needed to be treated in hospital. And roughly a quarter died due to complications. In we evaluated the costs – both financial and those related to human resources in health facilities – that Kenya’s public health facilities incurred treating complications stemming from unsafe abortions. We calculated that in 2012 the Kenyan government would have spent an estimated USD $5.1 million treating women who had developed complications from unsafe abortions. We estimated that by 2016 this figure would have gone up to USD $5.2 million. This is roughly what the Kenyan government spends funding free primary health care for six months of the year. And the same amount could provide effective contraceptives to about 50 000 Kenyan women who are of reproductive age. Treating these women also puts additional strain on Kenya’s already stretched health care system. To manage the problem Kenya needs to take urgent action to implement policies and laws that it has in place that are designed to protect women, particularly their reproductive rights. For example, women need better access to a range of contraceptives. But this kind of change requires political will to strengthen governmental institutions and agencies mandated to protect women’s health. Counting the costs For our study we analysed the national and regional distribution of abortion complications by caseload and severity along with data on the direct costs attached to these. We interviewed health care providers in panels and individually. And then we also looked at the amount of time health care providers spent with patients, the drugs they prescribed, and the supplies they required. Using these details we were able to calculate the costs for treating mild, moderate and severe complications. We were also able to establish which region in Kenya spent the most to treat complications. We found that most of the complications were moderate to severe. These were classified as medical emergencies, meaning they either were or could quickly become life threatening if they were not treated immediately. To treat these complications patients required extended hospital stays, intensive care, and needed to be attended by highly skilled health providers. Health care workers could spend over 12 hours treating a patient with such complications. The procedures ranged from draining an abscess in the pelvis to repairing a cervical or vaginal tear. About 35% of the cases were classified as severe but they accounted for more than half of the total costs. As expected, severe complications cost the most: USD $2.7 million in total while treating moderate complications totalled USD $ 1.7 million. Mild complications cost USD $ 646,234. At the per-case level, typical treatment could cost on average US$ 39 for mild complications to USD $108 for severe complications. But our cost estimates were conservative. They exclude patients’ missed days of work, facility space, cost of referrals, and overheads. Our analysis showed that facilities in Rift Valley and Western regions of Kenya had spent more than the other seven regions treating the complications of unsafe abortions. They also had the greatest numbers of women admitted. Responding to the problem To reduce the number of unsafe abortions in Kenya, the root cause of the problems need to be addressed. There are several. For one, Kenya has a variety of policies around sexual and reproductive health rights through which public facilities are mandated to protect girls’ and women’s health. But in many regions women don’t have access to contraceptives. If these policies are implemented it would accelerate access to contraception. Health providers, women, and communities need to be educated about these policies and what they mean for womens’ rights to contraception, the prevention of unsafe abortions, and the availability of quality post abortion care. Women and men must also be able to access information about the most effective methods of contraception to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and the complications that arise from these procedures. In addition, family planning services need to be improved and more contraceptive choices need to be offered to girls and women. And post-abortion services – both family planning counselling and access to services – need to be available. * Hailemichael Gebreselassie, a senior research advisor at Ipas, a global non-profit that works to reduce maternal mortality, contributed to the writing of this article.

237,True,True,0.0,THE CONVERSATION,04 June 2018 - 18:00,,Kenya must wake up to threat of Rift Valley fever outbreak,,"Heavy rainfall in Kenya has left a trail of in parts of the country, leading to deaths and rendering roads impassable. Some rivers have burst their banks and dams have for the first time in many years. The heavy rains present an additional danger: a higher chance of outbreaks of Rift Valley fever, a mosquito borne disease caused by a virus that infects both animals and humans and eventually results in death. Heavy rainfall leads to low-lying grasslands, known as dambos, becoming flooded which in turn leads to Rift Valley fever hatching. The emerging infected female adults then initiate transmission to nearby animals which serve as amplifiers, infecting more mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. Rift Valley Fever spreads in a number of ways. Firstly people and animals can get it from being bitten by an infected mosquito bite. But the happen when people come into contact with infected animals’ blood, secretions or tissue. This can happen when animals are slaughtered, when they’re being helped to give birth, during veterinary procedures or when food is being prepared. In the last Kenya Rift Valley fever outbreak in 2006 more than 150 people died and another 700 were hospitalised in the North-Eastern region of the country, placing a significant strain on the already . There were also economic costs – an estimated for vaccinations, trade bans and the loss of livestock. The outbreak lasted for close to a year before authorities were able to get it under control. As the rainfall continues it’s important that national and county governments put various measures in place to prevent an outbreak. This includes controlling mosquitoes that spread Rift Valley fever, vaccinating livestock and educating the public on the importance of safe practises when they’re slaughtering or handling sick animals. Action that needs to be taken If steps aren’t taken urgently, Kenya will struggle to contain an outbreak when it happens. The steps that need to be taken include: Using forecasting and climatic models to predict the climatic conditions linked to the increased risk of an outbreak. This was done in 2006. Satellite images and weather forecasting data was used to . Ensuring that warning as well as animal health surveillance systems are in place for people and animals. This would ensure that new cases in animals were detected early, which in turn could improve disease control. Vector control: using insecticides that target mosquitoes at their breeding sites. This is important because mosquitoes are the initial source of infections. The challenge during floods is that there are too many breeding sites to do this feasibly. Animal vaccination programmes. The challenge is that, to be effective, animals must be vaccinated before an outbreak. If this is left too late it can in fact intensify the outbreak. This is because animals that are infected don’t always show symptoms. If they’re treated and multi-dose vials and re-used needles and syringes are then used on other animals, the virus can be spread. Restricting livestock movement to slow down the spread of the virus. Measures to prevent the outbreak must be accompanied by public health education initiatives. The messages should focus on teaching people how to reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission by safe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. This includes washing hands, wearing gloves and other protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues as well as when they slaughter animals. It should also discourage people from eating unsafe and partially cook fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In addition, health care workers caring for patients should implement standard safety precautions. This includes handling blood (including dried blood), all other body fluids, secretions and excretions (excluding sweat), regardless of whether they contain visible blood, and contact with non-intact skin and mucous membranes. Not the first The pending threat of a Rift Valley fever outbreak is not the first in Kenya. There have been 11 outbreaks between 1951 and 2007. Some, like the stretched from Kenya to Somalia and Tanzania. In Kenya it killed more than 450 people and affected another 100 000 people. In the 1950s the outbreak was initially confined to one district in Rift Valley province that is prone to flooding and where livestock were raised . But by the time the 2006 outbreak hit the outbreak had spread to . This expansion has been driven by several environmental factors including rainfall and temperature, the density and movement of livestock and the . This significantly complicates efforts to prevent an outbreak. Beyond East Africa there have also been severe Riftvalley fever outbreaks in other parts of Africa, including where 100 000 sheep died and close to 500 000 livestock had forced abortions, where more than 600 people died and more than 200 000 others were affected, Mauritania, Senegal, Sudan, Madagascar, and Saudi Arabia and Yemen in the .

238,True,True,0.0,THE CONVERSATION,02 July 2018 - 18:00,,Uganda’s new sex education ideas will do more harm than good,,"Uganda its first ever guideline on sex education. The National Sexuality Education Framework 2018 aims to provide a formal, national direction for sex education within Uganda’s schools, ensuring that all programmes adhere to the same approach. The problem is that Uganda’s society holds very traditional values. This is reflected in the country’s policies and laws, like the which came into force in 2014 and criminalises homosexuality. As a result of this social conservatism, the new sex education framework is based on religious and cultural values that instruct abstinence only teaching. Students are taught the virtue of premarital abstinence and marital faithfulness. They are also taught traditional gender roles for men and women and that masturbation and same-sex sexual relationships aren’t normal. This formalises what has already been happening. Uganda has taken an abstinence-only approach in schools for a long time. The framework just makes it a matter of national policy. But it doesn’t fit the reality. Many young people are already sexually active. We know this from the high rate of pregnancies and unsafe abortions in the country. One of the of death and disability among young Ugandan women are pregnancy-related. To understand what policies would make more sense for the sexual and reproductive health of young people, I conducted research among and sex education in secondary schools in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, between 2008 and 2013. My findings confirm that Uganda’s abstinence-only approach is problematic for a number of reasons. It limits students’ choices and it prevents them from trusting, accessing and using contraception. This in turn puts them at a higher risk of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and unsafe abortions. The framework also shelters students from understanding and questioning harmful gender roles and stigmatises students who don’t adhere to society’s morally-accepted norms and values. Safe sex strategies Uganda has incorporated sex education into primary and secondary schools for over 15 years. It was introduced as one of the to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and so focused on prevention. The government implemented a programme the Presidential Initiative on AIDS Strategy for Communication to Youth. This programme received a lot of international for only providing the “abstinence” option to students, as opposed to one which teaches condoms and other contraception use as well. Because of this, non-governmental organisations also started implementing to sex education in Ugandan schools. These aimed to provide positive, accurate and complete information about sexuality and to include discussions about gender, relationships and homosexuality. When the Ugandan government that some of these approaches were teaching homosexuality, it decided to launch the new framework. But my research shows that this could do more harm than good. Research from elsewhere shows that sex education programmes are when they promote contraception because it allows young people who are not abstaining to have safe sex. Teenagers need complete, accurate information to protect themselves against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Impact of policy I conducted in-depth interviews, held focus group discussions and observed lessons with 55 students and 40 teachers. My findings confirm that Uganda’s moral approach means many students either don’t use contraception or don’t use it properly. This puts them at risk of pregnancy or infection. For instance, some said that they had learned condoms can break easily and that hormonal contraception, like the pill, can make them infertile or have a baby with disabilities. Many indicated that a condom is only 99% safe and that they cannot trust that 1%. The findings also showed that abstinence-only education does not acknowledge structural factors, like gender and power relations, which make young people feel pressured to live up to gender norms. This could mean they become vulnerable to unsafe sexual practices, such as transactional sex whereby they exchange sex in return for money, gifts or school fees. As for the teachers, I found that their personal values – and whether they think comprehensive sex education is good for the students or not – isn’t an issue for all of them. Many felt that they were held back by the reality of the school system: certain content cannot be taught, and teachers fear they may lose their job if they deviate from the norm. What can be done Because the new framework means that morality, justified by culture and religion, will continue to be institutionalised in the schools’ regulations and curricula, teachers will continue with the abstinence-only approach. This presents a challenge for those working on sex education. They will need to think, and work, outside the box to ensure that young people in countries like Uganda can enjoy their sexual and reproductive health and rights despite conservative policies. It is possible. In 2014 Burundi a national module for comprehensive sex education in schools which meets international standards. , sex and sexuality was a taboo subject, and, like Uganda, contraception was frowned upon. However, reforms in the educational system created opportunities to adopt a more comprehensive approach. This was partially Burundi’s “Vision 2025” which flags high population growth as a barrier to long term development. Access to family planning was perceived as one of the key strategies to curb rapid growth. By , Assistant Professor of Population Studies, This article was originally published on .

239,True,True,3.0,THE CONVERSATION,29 November 2018 - 09:00,,What’s driving high pregnancy rates in Kenyan schools,,"During Kenya’s national schools exams, an alarming number of girls to be pregnant or in labour, and so couldn’t take the exam. In just , 72 girls taking the exams were pregnant while 38 gave birth before the test. The Conversation Africa’s Moina Spooner asked Michael Mutua to shed light on why so many girls are falling pregnant and what measures there are to support them. What is the prevalence of pregnancy in schools in Kenya? Cases of pregnancy among young girls is high. Teen pregnancy and motherhood rates 18%. About one in every five adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) has either had a live birth, or is pregnant with her first child. Rates increase with age: from 3% among girls at 15 years old, to 40% among girls at 19 years. But these figures could be higher as there’s no accurate data on pregnant girls younger than 15. The consequences of pregnancy at such a young age in Kenya aren’t good. The girls usually either drop out of school to have the child or take the risk of an unsafe abortion. Why are girls getting pregnant? In Kenya, 11% of teenagers are having sex before their 15th birthday. The rates in Uganda are about the same – 10% of adolescents have had sex. The number goes up dramatically as young girls get deeper into their teens: in Kenya an estimated 47% of teens are already sexually active before the age of 18 – the legal age of consent. Sexual activity has been encouraged by the proliferation of mobile phones, which encourage youth to be more sexually promiscuous because of “sexting” or access to porn. Another factor is that there isn’t proper sex education. In Kenya, conservative attitudes and traditional values tend to be the norm and adults aren’t open to talking about sex or the idea of sex before marriage. This means young people don’t get the education they need to make informed sexual choices. They’re also not taught about contraception which makes them to use them. The use of contraceptives reduce teen pregnancy. But in Kenya, contraceptive use among teens has low, increasing to just 10% in 2014 from 6% five years earlier. What type of support do these girls have during and after pregnancy? The girls have very little support. There’s a huge amount of social stigma that young girls face when they get pregnant before marriage. So a large number resort to abortion. But because abortion is illegal in Kenya, the girls unqualified abortion service providers, often in unsafe facilities. The risk of an unsafe abortion is among this age-group than any other. If they choose to keep the baby, because of the nurse or doctors’ moralistic views, discrimination at the communities and health care facilities. These facilities also don’t have services – like psychosocial support – to meet the special needs of teen mothers. What are their future prospects like? Do schools take them back in? One of the immediate social consequences of teenage pregnancy is school dropout – 10,000 and 13,000 girls leave school each year as a result out of six million girls enrolled in school. In 1996 Kenya introduced a school re-entry policy that aimed to ensure return to school for all pregnant girls soon after weaning their babies. But this is weakly implemented as there’s a mismatch between policy and practice, with many heads of schools not aware of the policy. The policy also enough financial support to be implemented – there’s not enough money to train teachers or principals on how to reintegrate the young mothers. A lack of financial and moral support from their parents, coupled with the shame they experience, are also key factors that prevent them from going back to school. What should be done to reduce the number of pregnancies? Comprehensive and age appropriate sexuality education is key and should be made available to adolescents and youth, from about the age of six years old. Rwanda, for example, a new sexuality education programme a couple of years ago. This was supported by a teacher-training programme in 1,508 secondary schools that covered the new curriculum and how to teach it. But this easy for Kenyan schools to accept because of deep-rooted conservative attitudes in the society. The school re-entry programme must also be revamped to support young mothers if they do get better. It needs to move beyond being just a policy and legal framework into a project that builds social acceptability and tolerance among various actors like; teachers, school administrators and parents. It must also include stronger links between schools and the health system. This will build that supports continued education among adolescents faced with early pregnancies.

Trump seized on a report in The New York Times that said Cruz had failed to disclose a second loan, from Citibank, that helped bankroll his 2012 Senate campaign. The Times earlier had reported that Cruz had not disclosed a loan from Goldman Sachs for the same campaign. Cruz's campaign has said the failure to report the loan was a paperwork error. ""He didn't report his bank loans,"" Trump told delegates to the South Carolina Tea Party Convention. Some booed Trump for criticising Cruz since they had cheered Cruz when he spoke to the group earlier. ""Say whatever you want,"" Trump said in response to the boos. ""He didn't report his bank loans... And then he acts like Robin Hood. Say whatever you want.."" Cruz did not mention Trump to the Tea Party event but talking to reporters in Fort Mill, S.C., earlier in the day he was unsparing. He suggested the New York billionaire and former reality TV star lacks the temperament to be president, pointing to his frequent Twitter assaults on his adversaries. He said Trump had attacked him because Cruz was a threat to him in Iowa. ""I think in terms of a commander-in-chief, we ought to have someone who isn't springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls,"" Cruz said. ""I think the American people are looking for a commander-in-chief who is stable and steady and a calm hand to keep this country safe."" Trying to prove Trump is not the conservative he says he is, Cruz's campaign released a video entitled ""Donald Trump's New York Values"" that linked to a 1999 interview Trump did on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in which Trump declared he favored a woman's right to abortion and supported gay marriage. The two candidates had clashed at the last Republican debate, on Thursday in Charleston, over the issue of ""New York values"" with Trump saying Cruz had insulted the city that absorbed the September 11, 2001, attacks and rebounded. Trump brought up the issue again at a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., hours before a scheduled address at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention in Myrtle Beach. Cruz's criticism of New York, he said, was a ""total disgrace.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-01-17-trump-cruz-escalate-attacks-on-each-other/
241,True,True,4.0,AGENCIES,02 April 2016 - 03:00,,Laws on abortion remain unchanged though it amounts to murder - Trump,,"Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has said US abortion laws should remain unchanged, although he believes the procedure amounts to murder. In an interview with CBS News, Trump said: ""The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way"". His comments come as Trump has struggled this week to articulate his position on abortion. He withdrew a call for women who have abortions to be punished, only hours after suggesting it. After an outpouring of criticism from both anti-abortion and abortion rights activists, Mr Trump later said only the people who perform abortions should face punishment. The comments end a rocky week for Trump on campaign trail. According to some polls, he is trailing Texas Senator Ted Cruz by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin, which hold its primary on Tuesday. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and his Republican rivals Cruz and John Kasich repeatedly criticised Trump's shifting comments on abortion. Cruz said the remarks showed that Trump ""hasn't seriously thought through the issues"". Kasich - the popular governor of Ohio - also questioned whether Trump had the temperament needed for the office of the president. The Republican front-runner supports a ban on abortions, with some exceptions. Only the Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment has the power to overturn Roe v Wade and make abortion illegal. It was unclear from his comments to CBS whether Trump would no longer support appointing justices that would overturn Roe v Wade. He previously had said he would. Once a Democrat, Trump has been criticised for supporting abortion rights in the past. Anti-abortion activists traditionally have avoided placing blame on women who undergo abortions, but have focused on those who perform the procedure.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-04-02-laws-on-abortion-remain-unchanged-though-it-amounts-to-murder-trump/

The Republican front-runner is at risk of losing the Midwestern state to US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an outcome that would dent the New York billionaire's aura of inevitability and make it harder for him to win the 1,237 delegates needed for the party's nomination for the Nov. 8 election. On the Democratic side, US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is trying protect his lead over front-runner Hillary Clinton in the opinion polls in Wisconsin and eke out another victory over the former secretary of state. Trailing Cruz in the polls in Wisconsin, Trump on Sunday night told supporters in West Allis, Wisconsin, that Cruz was a liar and a ""dirty rotten cheater"" who is weak on immigration and would cut Social Security benefits. ""Wisconsin is going to be such a big surprise on Tuesday. We are doing so well,"" Trump said. A loss would add to Trump's woes after his campaign was rocked last week by the fallout from his suggestion, which he later dialed back, that women be punished for getting abortions if the procedure is banned. He also drew fire for comments that he would not rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and that Japan and South Korea might need nuclear weapons to ease the US financial commitment to their security. ""Was this my best week? I guess not,"" Trump told ""Fox News Sunday"" in an interview conducted Friday. But, he added: ""I think I'm doing OK."" Cruz, speaking to supporters on Sunday in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was eager to capitalize on Trump 's potential missteps. More Republicans are recognizing, said Cruz, that ""nominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck."" Cruz faces difficulty in winning the delegates needed to secure the nomination, given that the next states to vote, including New York on April 19, are Trump-friendly territory. Clinton is already eyeing New York, holding campaign stops there on Monday even as other candidates make their final pitches in Wisconsin. ""I'm absolutely confident I will be the nominee,"" Clinton told ABC in an interview that aired Monday as she and Sanders continued to spar over scheduling more debates. Sanders adviser Tad Devine said the Vermont Senator wanted another prime-time debate with Clinton. ""If we can continue to win, if he has a good day tomorrow, we're going to make his case through New York all the way to California,"" he told CNN. Republicans Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, third in the race, want to deny Trump enough delegates so that the nominee is determined at the Republican National Convention in July. Over the weekend, Trump complained Kasich was an irritant gobbling up some of the delegates Trump needs. ""The problem is he's in the way of me, not Cruz,"" Trump said. Kasich, who has vowed to stay in the race, tweeted: ""That's not how our republic works, Donald. We'll keep fighting until someone reaches a majority of delegates."" On Monday, RNC strategist Sean Spicer said the party would ""never tell any candidate to get in or out of the race."" ""The party is simply the arbiter, the people who put on the show to ensure that these delegates have a system to vote,"" he told CNN.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-04-04-in-wisconsin-trump-looks-to-put-rough-week-behind-him/
243,True,True,1.0,REUTERS,04 April 2016 - 09:00,,Trump's prediction of 'massive recession' puzzles economists,,"Donald Trump 's prediction that the US economy was on the verge of a ""very massive recession"" hit a wall of skepticism on Sunday from economists who questioned the Republican presidential front-runner's calculations. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Saturday, the billionaire businessman said a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump. He put real unemployment above 20 per cent. ""We're not heading for a recession, massive or minor, and the unemployment rate is not 20 per cent,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research in New York. The official unemployment rate has declined to 5 per cent from a peak of 10 per cent in October 2009, according to government statistics. But a different, broader measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment is at 9.8 per cent. Coming off a difficult week of campaigning, in which he acknowledged he struggled to articulate his position on abortion among other missteps, Trump's comments to the Post might be some of his most bearish on the economy and financial markets. ""I think we're sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,"" he said. Some economists agree the stock market is in a period of overvaluation but do not see that as foretelling a cataclysmic economic downturn originating in the United States. ""Nobody can predict what the stock market is going to do,"" said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. ""I cannot predict a stock market crash, so I cannot predict a recession. I don't see any of the reasons for a recession going forward unless there is a huge problem with the market or there is some catastrophic world event which is beyond the scope of economics."" Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, put the probability of an imminent recession at less than 10 per cent. ""If it happens, it would be because of what is happening overseas, especially in China and Europe,"" he said. 'US STILL SOLID ENOUGH' Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Pennsylvania, said it would take a ""total financial meltdown"" to trigger a recession. ""We can get by with Europe growing minimally,"" he said. ""We can get by with China growing modestly because the rest of the US is still solid enough that we can handle weakness in the rest of the world."" The Democratic National Committee criticised Trump for his remarks, saying they ""undermine our economy."" Trump 's success with voters, despite his sometimes saying things only to contradict them later, has also alarmed many leading figures within his own party. Some of them are openly plotting to try to prevent him from becoming the nominee at the party's national convention in July. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said on Sunday that voters were ""afraid"" of their economic situation, when asked about Trump's remarks on CNN's ""State of the Union"" show. ""When people are afraid and when they're angry, sometimes people say things that they regret,"" he said, apparently referring to Trump's remarks. He also played down speculation that party leaders would seek to dislodge Trump by helping someone who is not even a declared candidate prevail at the convention, which becomes governed by complicated voting rules if no candidate arrives with a clear majority. ""I think that our candidate is someone who's running,"" Priebus said, referring to Trump, US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The candidates will next face voters on Tuesday in Wisconsin, where recent polls show Cruz holding a small lead over Trump.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-04-04-trumps-prediction-of-massive-recession-puzzles-economists/

The deaths occurred in the town of Ambo in Oromiya region, where security forces clashed with protesters demanding the release of people detained during earlier demonstrations over an aborted attempt by the government to commandeer local land. Under a 25-year development programme, the government had intended to incorporate part of Oromiya into the boundaries of the capital Addis Ababa, only scrapping the plan after months of protests. Saturday's demonstrations, which witnesses said also took place in the capital and in the Oromiya town of Woliso, were to press for the release of people detained in those earlier protests.

Democrat Obama said he was hopeful about reaching agreements with the Republican-majority Congress on funding to fight the Zika virus and for disaster relief after flooding in Louisiana. The president met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on issues that have been a struggle as his second term winds down. ""My hope is that by the time Congress adjourns before the election that we will have an agreement in place to fund the government and that our Zika funding will be taken care of,"" Obama told reporters in the Oval Office.

Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. Shortly before the meeting with Obama, McConnell said congressional leaders were making progress on legislation on temporary spending and Zika. McConnell said he expected to advance the legislation in the Senate this week. Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to the temporary spending bill. In February, Obama had asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika with diagnostic tools and vaccines, but disagreements over side issues related to abortion have led to divisions about full funding.

During his traditional, freewheeling in-flight news conference with reporters on the plane returning from Azerbaijan, Francis was asked how he would counsel American faithful and what wisdom they should keep in mind. ""You have asked me a question that describes a difficult choice because, according to you, there are difficulties with one and difficulties with the other,"" the pope said, without naming Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump. In posing the question, the reporter made allusions to Clinton's support of abortion and Trump's statements vilifying migrants and religious minorities.

248,True,True,4.0,REUTERS,06 October 2016 - 15:00,,Thailand relaxes abortion laws amid Zika outbreak,,"Predominantly Buddhist Thai land will relax its strict rules against abortion to cover fetuses with proven birth defects linked to the Zika virus, health officials said on Thursday, doubling to 24 weeks a deadline for the procedure. Thai land last week confirmed its first known cases of microcephaly linked to the mosquito-borne virus. The two cases of the birth defect marked by a small head were the first in Southeast Asia, following Zika outbreaks in the Americas. Health experts who met this week to draft guidelines for expectant mothers with Zika concluded that abortion s can be carried out at up to 24 weeks in case of serious birth defects. ""The difficulty with Zika is to determine microcephaly. It is usually found later in pregnancy,"" Pisek Lumpikanon, president of the Royal Thai College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told Reuters. ""Legal medical abortion s can be done up to 24 weeks,"" he added. ""The reason is that at 24 weeks and after the baby already has a good chance of survival."" Abortion is illegal in Thai land, except in cases of rape or to save a woman's life or preserve her health, and if carried out in up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Beyond that time, hospitals must decide on a case-by-case basis. There are no specific tests to determine if a baby will be born with microcephaly but ultrasound scans can identify it in the third trimester of pregnancy, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Thai land has said it is considering testing all pregnant women for Zika. Inadequate screening by health authorities across Southeast Asia is likely to lead to significant under-reporting of the spread of Zika, regional experts say. Thai land has confirmed 392 cases of Zika since January, with 39 pregnant women among them, while the wealthy city-state of Singapore has recorded 393 cases, including 16 pregnant women. Despite its laissez-faire reputation among travelers, Thai land remains largely conservative, and Theravada Buddhism, the form of the religion practiced by up to 95 per cent of its people, regards abortion as a sin. That might lead some doctors to decline to terminate pregnancies, Pisek said, adding, ""Buddhism won't affect the law, but some doctors might refuse.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-10-06-thailand-relaxes-abortion-laws-amid-zika-outbreak/
249,True,True,2.0,REUTERS,22 November 2016 - 15:00,,US Senate Republicans willing to oppose Trump gain leverage,,"It is no surprise that Democrats in the US Congress will oppose Donald Trump but the most important resistance to fulfilling the president-elect's agenda is beginning to emerge from Republicans on Capitol Hill. A small number of influential Republicans in the Senate are threatening to block appointments to Trump 's administration, derail his thaw with Russia and prevent the planned wall on the border with Mexico. The party held onto control of the Senate at the November 8 election but by only a thin margin, putting powerful swing votes in just a few hands. That empowers Republican Senate mavericks such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. Both were bitter rivals to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Paul, a libertarian lone wolf, says he will block Senate confirmations if Trump nominates either former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former UN Ambassador John Bolton to be secretary of state. South Carolina's Lindsay Graham has started publicly outlining places he might be willing to oppose Trump. He is against the Mexican border wall and is delivering warnings against Trump's intention to revoke legal status for undocumented immigrants brought here as children - although that would not require congressional approval. Graham, a traditional Republican foreign policy hawk, strongly disagrees with Trump's attempt to improve ties with Russia. ""I am going to be kind of a hard ass"" on Russia, Graham told reporters recently. ""We can't sit on the sidelines"" and let cyber attacks blamed on Russia ""go unanswered."" The early stirrings of opposition from Senate Republicans are a sign that the New York businessman, who has never held public office, might run into harsh political realities soon after taking office on January 20. Other Senators who might defy Trump are Arizona's John McCain and Jeff Flake, Nebraska's Ben Sasse, Florida's Marco Rubio, Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, said senior Senate aides and lawmakers. These lawmakers have ruffled feathers in the past and some have a good political reason not to fear Trump: Paul, McCain, Murkowski and Rubio do not have to run for re-election until 2022. Graham, Collins and Sasse will have to face the voters in 2020; Cruz and Flake have an earlier election, in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose job is to keep the Republicans in line, knows the challenges ahead. A senior Republican aide said McConnell is ""loathe"" to spend time trying to move bills that lack the needed Senate votes. McConnell is aware he will not have the support of some of his own lawmakers on bills that could pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, such as appropriating money to build the Mexican wall and further abortion restrictions, the aide said. Democratic strays But Trump has a history of taming what appear to be well-entrenched Republican opponents. He won the party nomination against all the odds and some of his staunchest opponents like Rubio and Cruz ended up endorsing him. And swing votes in the Senate cut two ways. The Democrats have their own potential renegades such as West Virginia's Joe Manchin, who has already declared his support for Trump's nomination of Republican Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Such swings by Democrats toward Republicans may be likelier ahead of the 2018 elections, when Democrats must defend more vulnerable Senate seats than Republicans. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer must deal with this. Trump said over the weekend he and Schumer ""always had a good relationship."" Republicans are likely to control only 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, meaning three defections within the party are enough to block cabinet appointments which only require 50 votes. Vice President-elect Mike Pence would break 50-50 ties. The task for McConnell gets more difficult when it comes to passing legislation, which requires 60 votes, known as cloture, to allow a bill to move forward. If Trump plans to sign a bill while in office, perhaps one that will change immigration law or restrict abortions, McConnell will have to keep all Republicans in line and win over an additional eight Democrats. Trump could deliver on campaign promises that do not require legislative approval like blocking the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal or ending the Iran nuclear pact. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, enjoys robust Republican support and would be done through a legislative maneuver that does not require any Democratic support. Collins and Murkowski have a history of crossing the aisle to join Democrats and could shy from abortion restrictions. Cruz has never feared disrupting Senate business to prove a point or seek concessions in legislation. Sasse did not waver from his staunch criticism of Trump through the campaign. Flake has said he is ""eating crow"" after Trump's win, but he could defect on immigration and border security, issues he has previously joined with Democrats on. Paul was asked last week on MSNBC if he would put a hold on Giuliani or Bolton. In the Senate, a hold allows a single senator to delay a confirmation. He left open the possibility of such a move, saying, ""I feel pretty strongly about it."" He said: ""We have a 52-48 majority, all it would take is two or three Republicans to say they can't go along with Giuliani and can't go along with Bolton.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2016-11-22-us-senate-republicans-willing-to-oppose-trump-gain-leverage/

A senior official from Crime Investigation Department (CID) in the eastern state of West Bengal said the arrests began on Monday after police raided a private nursing home and found two babies hidden in cardboard boxes in a locked medical storeroom. Those arrested included the owner, midwives and other staff at the nursing home in Baduria, 80 km (50 miles) from Kolkata. Police have also arrested court clerks suspected of making fake documentation for the children and the head of a charity which ran the adoption centre. ""The inquiry is underway and more information will be revealed only after some more progress is made,"" Bharat Lal Meena, Deputy Inspector General for the CID in West Bengal, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Staff at the nursing home and the charity were not immediately available for comment. Police said initial investigations indicated that unmarried girls and women who visited the clinic for an abortion were persuaded by staff to give birth and sell their babies. The police did not give a price, but local news reports said the mothers were given 300,000 rupees ($4,380) for a boy and 100,000 rupees ($1,460) for a girl. Babies were also stolen from women who delivered at the clinic, but who were told by staff that their children were stillborn. Some were even shown the bodies of stillborn babies preserved by the clinic to dupe parents, police said. The babies, mostly newborns, were then smuggled in cartons used to store biscuits, and taken by road to an adoption centre 25 km (15 miles) away in Machlandapur, where they were sold on to childless couples. ""It was a well organised syndicate, incorporating all kinds of helping hands needed for the smuggling network,"" said another CID official, who did not wish to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to reporters. The CID officer said more arrests were likely in the coming days. Reports of human trafficking in India increased by 25 per cent in 2015 compared to the previous year, with more than 40 per cent of cases involving children being bought, sold and exploited as modern day slaves, government crime data shows. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said there were 6,877 cases related to human trafficking last year against 5,466 in 2014, with the highest number of cases reported in the northeast state of Assam, followed by West Bengal state. South Asia, with India at its centre, is one of the fastest-growing regions for human trafficking in the world. Gangs sell thousands of victims into bonded labour every year or hire them out to exploitative bosses. Many women and girls are sold into brothels.

Looking to seize upon the momentum of the Women's March on Washington on January 21, the day after Trump's inauguration, the one-day protest coincides with International Women's Day with events in more than 50 countries, organizers said. The day was modeled in part after pro-immigrant demonstrations on February 16, the latest in a series of anti-Trump protests since his November 8 election. ""I had to go to show that is not my president. Every time he opens his mouth, it's a garbage can,"" said Iloane Lila, 73, who joined thousands of women at a rally in New York City's Central Park. Lila, a Trinidad native, said she asked for the day off from her job as a nanny and attended her first-ever political rally in January, prompted by her anger at Trump. A similar crowd gathered at Washington and other rallies were planned in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco. At least three US school districts, in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, closed on Wednesday because of staff shortages. Trump, whose 11-year-old comments about grabbing and kissing women against their will surfaced during the campaign, took to his Twitter account early on Wednesday to cite International Women's Day and the ""critical role"" of women around the world. ""I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy,"" the Republican president tweeted. It was unknown how many women may have sacrificed a day's pay or withheld their purchasing power from the economy. At a rally of about 100 people in St Petersburg, Florida, Tammye Moore, 55, a self-employed event planner said she was taking an earnings hit to attend. ""It's important enough to pause for this cause, because the loss would be greater for me not to be here today,"" Moore said. By having women, who make up 47 percent of the US civilian labor force, flex their economic muscle, organizers hope to call attention to the gender pay gap, access to reproductive health services, and Trump's actions that have restricted access to abortion overseas. American women on average earn 79 cents for every $1 that men make, and African-American and Latina women make even less, said Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women. Since women account for two-thirds of all minimum wage workers, lifting the hourly wage would significantly narrow the pay gap, she said. The minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 at the federal level since 2009, although it is higher in many states. Not all women, however, were on board with the call for a women's strike, with some critics citing the vagueness of the movement's aims and the disruptive effects of a work stoppage. Organizers, aware that many women lack the motivation or cannot afford to take a day off, are also urging women to limit shopping for the day to stores owned by women and minorities or small business. Women could also wear red to show their support. O'Neill said the rallies and activities had a partisan edge that may not make all women feel welcome. ""People who voted for Trump need to think long and had about what they imposed upon our country,"" O'Neill said. Among the targets of some demonstrations are a Trump ""gag order"" that bars foreign health providers receiving US funds from raising abortion as an option, she said.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2017-03-08-women-in-us-sacrifice-days-pay-in-anti-trump-protests/
254,True,True,1.0,THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION,09 March 2017 - 15:00,,"After rape, pregnancy, Senegal's 'pink house' helps women rebuild lives",,"When Binta found out she was pregnant, she knew she would have to leave her home in southern Senegal. Pregnancy outside of marriage is taboo in the West African nation and abortions are punishable by jail. The father of Binta's child was an extended family member, she said, not specifying whether their relations were consensual. ""I didn't know how to tell my family about this... The family is too sacred,"" the 30-year-old said. Her name and those of other women interviewed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation have been changed to protect their privacy. So Binta made up an elaborate story about finding a job and packed her bags for Guediawaye, a poor suburb on the outskirts of capital Dakar, where a social worker had told her she could find refuge at the Maison Rose, French for ""pink house"". An old court building with pink-painted walls, the Maison Rose is a rare refuge in Senegal for women and girls who have fled abuse, rape, forced marriage and other trauma. Hundreds of people have found sanctuary there in its nine years. ""Anything that can happen in Senegal, we've seen it,"" said French founder Mona Chasserio, who has given the shelter a warm and homely feel. Most women come to see out unexpected pregnancies and give birth, she said. Now Chasserio is broadening its impact by including more job training programmes to help the women gain economic independence when they leave. The shelter also teaches community leaders how to handle sensitive cases and guide women toward support. The Maison Rose aims to help women recover from psychological trauma through music, art, and other types of therapy. The women do daily activities to relax and refocus and when they are ready, begin learning professional skills. Six toddlers played in the sunny courtyard one morning while their mothers shared stories as part of a workshop. Binta sat across from a 16-year-old girl who was seven months pregnant from rape. Building economic and social resilience is the goal, said Chasserio, but she believes that peace of mind must come first. ""End of the world"" Senegal ranks high in some areas of gender equality, with equal access for girls to primary education and one of the world's highest proportions of women in parliament. But in other areas women are disadvantaged and vulnerable. Domestic violence is a widespread problem, abortion laws are strict and child marriage is common, experts say. Single women have difficulty accessing contraception and often lack basic information about it because it is expected that they will remain virgins until marriage, said Sanou Gning, country director at international charity Marie Stopes. ""When a woman who is not married gets pregnant, it is the end of the world,"" she said. The stigma leaves unmarried pregnant women with few choices. They can tell their families about it and risk being thrown out of the house, or seek an unsafe abortion, which could land them in jail. Many run away from home instead, said Gning. There are a few shelters in Senegal that will take them in, she said, but not enough for all the girls in need. Many unmarried mothers end up in the streets and are forced to beg. The Maison Rose takes women to a nearby hospital to give birth and helps with early childcare. In some cases it even brings in the mother's family to convince parents or relatives to let the girl come home. ""I think it is an initiative that needs to multiply throughout Senegal,"" said Marie Sabara, a national programme officer at UN Women, of the Maison Rose. Job training Many of the women who have left the shelter have gone on to vocational schools, while others have found work as hairdressers or tailors, Chasserio said. ""The problem here is jobs for women are extremely limited,"" she added. Women lack a strong presence outside of traditionally female fields in Senegal such as sewing, housekeeping and hair salons. Chasserio is planning to rent a building next door to expand Maison Rose's training programmes. She plans to start a store to sell the women's jewellery and crafts and has an partnership with a local mill so the women can get jobs making bread. Women who leave the shelter often bring their children back for holidays, she said, and are always welcome to seek advice or provide it to newcomers. ""It's helped me a lot,"" said Fatima, 24, whose mother brought her to the shelter after she got pregnant. She is taking a class in couture at the Maison Rose and hopes to find a job in a clothing shop. ""I came to rebuild myself,"" she said. The shelter is expanding its work with social workers and religious leaders so that they know when women should be referred. Chasserio also hopes to train others in Senegal and across West Africa to start similar shelters of their own. ""Here we see lots of suffering, but you can see (the women) change,"" Chasserio said.

The decision not to attend the UN's Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a show of support for women excluded due to the US travel ban on visitors from six majority-Muslim nations, Masimanyane Women's Rights International said. The CSW, which begins on Monday, is an annual two-week session when diplomats, advocates and others meet to discuss gender equality and women's empowerment. A number of advocates hoping to participate in this year's meetings have been denied visas, including women from Ghana, Cameroon, Nepal and Bangladesh, according to the International Women's Health Coalition, a leading US-based rights group. ""Some have been declined but it is not entirely clear what the reason is,"" a spokeswoman said. UN Women said more than 8,000 people registered for the meetings, and ""so far, we have not heard from anyone from these countries about visa issues."" ""We trust that the US as the host country of the UN will continue to enable the organization to carry out its critical work,"" said a spokeswoman for U.N. Women, the global body's entity that promotes gender equality and women's empowerment. A UN spokesman also said: ""So far the groups that are trying to attend the Commission on the Status of Women, as far as we're aware none of them have been denied entry."" A US State Department official said visa records are confidential and that the department would not comment on individual cases. The South African women's group said it had ""serious concerns about the far-reaching impact of the recent spate of executive orders which serve to exclude, demonize and criminalize"" women. ""We regretfully will no longer be traveling to New York, nor will we be participating in the panel discussion that we had planned for the CSW,"" said Lesley Ann Foster, executive director of Masimanyane, in a statement this week. Trump on Monday signed a revised executive travel order, replacing a more sweeping ban issued in January that caused chaos and protests at airports. The new order keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It excludes Iraq, which was listed in the earlier order. The earlier order was halted by a federal judge. Read: Some of Trump's other orders have also drawn criticism as rolling back women's rights - such as the so-called global gag rule that cuts funding to international women's health groups that mention the topic of abortion. Last month, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, said it would not attend the CSW session.

256,True,True,1.0,REUTERS,29 April 2017 - 12:00,,Climate protests to mark Trump's 100 days in office,,"For the second time in a month, tens of thousands of protesters are expected to turn out in Washington on Saturday to voice concern over climate change in a mass demonstration marking the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency. The Peoples Climate Marches in dozens of cities including the US capital, are part of a broader effort to build momentum behind candidates with strong environmental records for next year's midterm elections and the 2020 presidential race, organisers said. ""We're using this as a tactic to advance the strategy of building enough power to win on climate over the course of the long haul,"" said Paul Getsos, national coordinator for the Peoples Climate Movement. Sponsors of Saturday's events include labor unions, the Sierra Club and civil rights groups. As a side theme, marchers will protest Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants and other issues championed by the maverick Republican billionaire. Since Trump's inauguration on January 20, there have been national protests focused on issues ranging from abortion rights to immigration and science policy. Last weekend, thousands turned out for the March for Science, a de facto protest against what activists call a denial in Trump's Washington of evidence-based science. Trump's administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which more than 190 countries signed in hopes of curbing global warming. Trump has also proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency. In his campaign, Trump called climate change a hoax. Last month he kept a promise to the coal industry by undoing climate-change rules put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama. Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, said the march would have little impact on the administration. ""The real decisions are made in this country in elections, and we have now a president and a House and a Senate that are determined to pursue a pro-energy agenda,"" he said by telephone. Environmental activists believe public opinion is on their side. A Gallup poll this month showed 59 per cent of Americans agreed environmental protection should take priority over increased US energy production. Trump representatives had no immediate comment on the planned protest. In the main event in Washington, protesters will march from the Capitol to surround the White House, then hold a rally. Dozens of ""sister"" marches are planned for other North America locales, from Anapolish Royal, Nova Scotia, to Dutch Harbor in Alaska's Aleutian Islands.

257,True,True,2.0,BBC,17 May 2017 - 03:00,,India doctors allow 10-year-old rape victim to abort,,"A panel of doctors has accepted a 10-year-old rape victim's plea for an abortion in the northern Indian state of Haryana. Dr Ashok Chauhan told the BBC the termination would be carried out ""anytime now"". The girl became pregnant about five months ago. She alleges rape by her stepfather, who has been arrested. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors confirm the woman's life is in danger. The decision to allow the child to abort was taken after a local court told doctors at the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in the town of Rohtak that it would accept their recommendation. India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children globally. But there's a general reluctance to talk about the problem and it's rarely discussed in public. Studies have shown that in large numbers of cases, like in the case of the 10-year-old rape victim in Rohtak, the abusers are known to the children and include care-givers like parents, relatives and teachers. Contrary to the popular belief that only girls are abused, boys are equally at risk; and children from affluent families are just as much at risk as those from poor backgrounds. Campaigners say sexual abuse of children goes unchecked because the victims are often afraid to report it to their parents or teachers, and also because parents themselves often hush it up, fearing family dishonour. But in recent years India has been waking up to the problem and on Tuesday, child rights charity World Vision India launched a new campaign to end child sexual abuse by 2021. The campaign aims to impact five million children across 200 districts and calls on every Indian citizen to work to break the silence that surrounds child abuse. Campaigners say India's culture at present stands on the side of the offender, and that must change. The tough law against abortion was introduced to fight India's skewed gender ratio. A deep-seated cultural preference for sons has led to millions of female foetuses being aborted over the years by pregnant women after undergoing foetal gender testing. In recent months India's Supreme Court has received several petitions, some from women who were raped, wanting to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks. The court has always referred the matter to medical experts.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2017-05-17-india-doctors-allow-10-year-old-rape-victim-to-abort/

259,True,True,0.0,REUTERS,22 June 2017 - 18:00,,"Senate Republicans release Obamacare replacement bill, fate uncertain",,"US Senate leaders on Thursday unveiled a draft of legislation to replace Obamacare, proposing to kill a tax on the wealthy that pays for it and reduce aid to the poor to cut costs. But the draft bill's fate was immediately thrown into question by a statement from Senator Rand Paul and three other conservative Republicans, who said they are ""not ready to vote"" for it. Democrats need the support of only three Republicans to kill the bill. The emergence of four Senate skeptics underscored the difficulty for Republicans of steering the legislation down a narrow path to passage. Democrats already deeply opposed Republican attempts to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The 142-page proposal, worked out by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with other Republican leaders in secret, was welcomed by President Donald Trump. The president privately bashed as ""mean"" a version passed last month in the Republican-led House of Representatives, according to congressional sources. Trump, who had said on Wednesday that he wanted a health plan ""with heart,"" told reporters at the White House that healthcare legislation will require ""a little negotiation, but it's going to be very good."" He said he doubted Democrats would help. The Obamacare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, is credited with expanding health insurance to millions of Americans since its passage in 2010. Republicans say it costs too much and involves the federal government too much in healthcare. Trump made Obamacare repeal a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign. The Senate's draft bill proposes repealing the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners retroactively to the start of 2017. The tax, which affects high-income Americans and was imposed to help pay for Obamacare, has been a key target for Republicans. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. It would phase out Obamacare’s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled over three years, from 2021 to 2024, and then enact deeper cuts in the program than the House version, beginning in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees. The legislation also reshapes subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. ""The current bill does not repeal Obamacare,"" Paul said. ""It does not keep our promises to the American people. I will oppose it coming to the floor in its current form, but I remain open to negotiations."" Democratic leaders of Congress, who want the Obamacare law fixed but not abandoned, immediately attacked Senate Republicans' version. ""The president said the House bill was mean,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. ""The Senate bill may be even meaner."" McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill. ""I regret that our Democratic friends made clear early on that they did not want to work with us in a serious, bipartisan way to address the Obamacare status quo. But Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,"" McConnell said. Like the House bill, the Senate would repeal a penalty associated with the individual mandate requiring most people to have health insurance or else pay a fine. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The legislation would also repeal the penalty associated with the employer mandate that they provide employees health insurance. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion per year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion per year in 2020 and 2021. The Senate bill proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version. There is some uncertainty over whether abortion-related provisions will meet Senate rules, but those provisions could be included in another Senate bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the House bill would kick 23 million people off their healthcare plans. The CBO is expected to weigh in on the Senate draft bill early next week. As lawmakers made speeches about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnell's personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting ""no cuts to Medicaid."" Capitol police were on the scene and physically removing protesters. Hospitals stocks surge US hospital stocks were trading sharply higher after the bill was released. HCA Healthcare Inc rose 3.2 per cent, while Tenet Healthcare Corp surged 6.8 per cent. Health insurers were also trading broadly higher with large players Aetna and UnitedHealth Group each up about 1 percent. Insurers that specialize in Medicaid were also gaining, with Centene up 3.5 per cent and Molina Healthcare rising 3.2 per cent. The overall S&P 500 healthcare sector was up 1.5 per cent and hit an all-time high. The healthcare sector has surged this week, fueled by biotechnology stocks. The sector has gained more than 4 percent this week already, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology index jumping 10 per cent. “Hospital stocks are up on this news today,"" Mizuho Securities' director of research, Sheryl Skolnick, said in a research note. ""They should be, in our view, as the near-term risks would be abated if the subsidy and Medicaid provisions hold through Senate and House negotiations.” The subsidies enabling low-income people to buy private health insurance are expected to be linked to recipients' income in the Senate bill, a ""major improvement"" from a measure approved last month by the House that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said. Some of the Senate bill's provisions could be political land mines, with individual senators' reactions crucial to determining whether or not Obamacare survives a Republican attack that has been underway since its 2010 enactment. But, even though Republicans now have control of the White House as well as both chambers of Congress, they have struggled to make good on their bold campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare. Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican bill will make healthcare unaffordable for poorer Americans while cutting taxes for the wealthy. McConnell may have a tough job convincing enough Republican senators that the Senate bill improves on the House version. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month found nearly 60 per cent of adults believed the House bill would make insurance costlier for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Only 13 per cent said it would improve the quality of healthcare.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2017-06-22-senate-republicans-release-obamacare-replacement-bill-fate-uncertain/

A statement from the airport said: ""Due to reports of a drone observation in the vicinity of the airfield, runway operations at Gatwick were suspended between 18:10 BST and 1819, and again from 1836 to 1841, resulting in a small number of go-arounds and diverts. ""Operations have resumed and the police continue to investigate."" 'Lots of babies' Passengers have told the BBC they were diverted mid-flight. Craig Jenkins was flying back with Easyjet from Naples in Italy when his flight was diverted. ""We were crossing over the Channel and it started circling,"" he said. ""It did four or five circles, heading further east, before the captain said we were landing at Stansted. ""First, they said Gatwick was closed because of an incident.

More than 14,000 women, who were treated at BPAS clinics, became pregnant despite using the pill or a long-acting contraceptive. They often spotted their pregnancy late because they hadn't expected their contraception to fail. No method of contraception can ever be 100% effective. But long-acting reversible methods are said to have a very low failure rate (99 per cent effective). Oral contraceptive pills are by far the most popular way of protecting against unplanned pregnancy among women, but long-acting methods - known as Larcs - are catching up. They include contraceptive injections, implants and intra-uterine devices (IUDs) or systems (IUSs). Contraceptive pills are estimated to be 91% effective while condoms are 82% effective when used typically. However, BPAS says unplanned pregnancies can occur if the method is not inserted properly, or if it moves or falls out. It also says hormonal contraception, such as the pill or patch, can mask the symptoms of pregnancy because they may cause light or irregular periods. This may be why women using these methods have abortions at a later stage than other women. BPAS said that in 2015, more than 5% of women having abortions past 20 weeks were using Larcs, compared to around 3% of those having one at less than 19 weeks.

Both the men were the child's uncles. The sentencing is set for Thursday. Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. The second uncle was arrested after the baby's DNA sample did not match that of his older brother, the first suspect. The final arguments were completed by the defence on Monday. On Tuesday, the two men were declared guilty in court. The older uncle's trial took a month, while the younger uncle has been convicted in a remarkable 18-day trial, BBC Punjabi's Arvind Chhabra reports from Chandigarh. The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally. She was 30 weeks pregnant when a local court in Chandigarh turned down her abortion plea on the grounds that her pregnancy was too advanced. A doctors' panel had advised that a medical termination would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption. The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle, who is in his 40s. She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed details about her abuse. The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations.

The second uncle was arrested after the baby's DNA sample did not match that of his older brother, the first suspect. The older uncle's trial took a month, while the younger uncle was convicted in a remarkable 18-day trial The harrowing case of the 10-year-old victim has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally. She was 30 weeks pregnant when a local court in Chandigarh turned down her abortion plea, on the grounds that her pregnancy was too advanced. A panel of doctors had advised that a medical termination would be ""too risky"". Later, India's Supreme Court also refused to allow her an abortion on similar grounds. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bump was caused by a stone in her stomach, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption. The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle, who is in his 40s. She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed details about her abuse. The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations.

266,True,True,6.0,REUTERS @Reuters,30 January 2018 - 06:00,,Ireland to hold abortion referendum at the end of May,,"Ireland's government on Monday proposed holding a referendum to liberalise the country's abortion regime at the end of May, offering voters the first opportunity in 35 years to overhaul some of the world's strictest laws. Abortion has long been a divisive issue in once stridently Catholic Ireland, which has witnessed a wave of social change in recent years. It became the first country in the world to adopt gay marriage by popular vote in 2015. Voters will be asked if they wish to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution that was inserted in 1983 and enshrined the equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child, and to instead enable parliament to set the laws. While not on the ballot paper, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said his government would begin drafting legislation in line with the recommendations made by an all-party parliamentary committee last month, which called for terminations with no restrictions to be allowed up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. ""We already have abortion in Ireland but it's unsafe, unregulated and unlawful and in my opinion we cannot continue to export our problems and import our solutions,"" Varadkar told a news conference, referring to the thousands of women who travel abroad or use abortion pills to end their pregnancies each year. ""I believe that this is a decision about whether we want to continue to stimgatise and criminalise our sisters, our co-workers and our friends or whether we are prepared to take a collective act of leadership to show empathy and compassion,"" said Varadkar, who will campaign for the laws to change. A complete ban on abortion was lifted in Ireland in 2013 when terminations were allowed in cases where the mother's life was in danger. The debate around that change elicited street protests from both sides and a heated debate is expected in the coming months. Two opinion polls in recent days found that between 51 percent and 56 percent of voters would support a proposal to allow abortion up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, with just under 30 percent opposed and the rest undecided. However, the polls showed a sharp generational divide with a clear majority of voters over 65 opposed. Analysts have said that those against the proposal are more likely to actually vote and that many of the undecided voters are likely to oppose the changes. For those reasons, pro-choice activists have been pressuring the government to hold the referendum in May to maximise the number of students who can vote before many leave to spend the summer months traveling or working overseas. Nobody under the age of 50 has voted on comprehensive abortion reforms in Ireland. Its 39-year-old leader was not old enough to cast a ballot when a referendum was passed in 1992 to allow women the right to obtain information and travel abroad for a termination. A date is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks. ""I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make. It is a very personal and private issue and for most of us it's not a black and white issue, it is one that is grey,"" Varadkar said. ""If it is approved, and I believe it will be approved, it will say that as a country we have come of age.""",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2018-01-30-ireland-to-hold-abortion-referendum-at-the-end-of-may/

The service is much needed in the central African country where many people lack basic information about contraceptives and the rate of teenage pregnancy is high, according to its founder Aime Lokulutu, a doctor in the capital Kinshasa. Only one in 10 Congolese women use modern contraception, and a quarter give birth before the age of 18, according to the latest data from the United Nations' Population Fund (UNFPA). ""We had many friends who got girlfriends pregnant when we were students, and I knew people who died from bad abortions,"" Lokulutu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. ""We did not have anyone who could give us appropriate information."" Embarrassment and stigma often prevent people from going to health clinics or seeking advice, he added. Lokulutu launched the app and website late last year with a team of doctors who answer questions. Users are anonymous but can see other people's questions, and the answers they receive. ""It is a very good idea,"" said Achu Lordfred, an advisor on reproductive health for UNFPA in Congo. ""There is enough information available, but young people have issues of ignorance and access."" Abortion is illegal in Congo and many people use dangerous methods to end unwanted pregnancies, Lordfred said. Sexual and reproductive health services are also unaffordable for much of the population, he added. Other mobile services in Congo give basic information on sexual health, but Doctor Love is the only one that provides personal responses, said Lokulutu. Three months after launching, the website has had about 11,000 visits. ""It makes people feel comfortable because they're actually talking to somebody,"" Lokulutu said. Other African entrepreneurs have created similar apps. In Rwanda, two medical students created a mobile app called Tantine last year to provide sexual health information and counselling to teenagers in refugee camps. Funded by UNFPA, the app is now available across the whole country and has 1,500-odd users, said co-founder Sylvie Uhirwa.

Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump's proposal was ""dead"" as soon as it arrived in Congress at the second of two House of Representatives hearings where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo faced lawmakers skeptical about the budget plan. ""This budget... signals to the world that the Trump foreign policy is one of disengagement,"" Engel said. The ranking Republican on the House of Representatives subcommittee that oversees State Department spending, Hal Rogers, described the budget plan at an earlier subcommittee hearing as ""woefully inadequate"" to cover the administration's foreign policy and security goals. The proposal slashes the State Department and aid budget by about $11 billion to $40 billion, he said. ""Given what the world looks like right now, this approach seems detached from reality,"" Rogers said, citing the need for U.S. leadership in a world with millions of displaced people, more countries facing instability and rising tensions. Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, who chairs the full Appropriations committee and the subcommittee, also rejected the ""draconian"" cuts. ""I am astonished that three years into his administration, the president still does not appreciate the merits of sustained investments in diplomacy and development,"" she said. In written remarks ahead of the hearings, Pompeo said the budget sought to double funds for countering China's increased aggression, and strengthen systems to target Russia's growing threats to the United States and Western world. ""China is proactively applying its power and exerting its influence in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,"" Pompeo said, adding: ""This budget prioritizes countering Russian malign influence in Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia, and further strengthens the Department's own systems against malign actors."" Pompeo said resources would also fund work to reach a deal with North Korea on curbing its nuclear program and push back against Iran's role in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. He said the budget also requests new authority to support a democratic transition in Venezuela, including transferring up to $500 million to foreign assistance accounts. 'EMBARRASSING AND DANGEROUS' Trump's proposal calls for spending more U.S. taxpayer money on the military and a U.S.-Mexico border wall, while overhauling social safety-net programs in a budget plan likely to die in Congress but live on in his 2020 re-election campaign. Democratic Representative Lois Frankel called Trump's budget proposal ""embarrassing and dangerous."" Several Democrats sharply criticized an expanded anti-abortion policy Pompeo outlined on Tuesday, which cuts funding to groups that support abortion. ""Your budget and action is devastating to the health of women around the world,"" Frankel said. ""Your administration is abortion obsessed,"" she said. Committee Republicans said they backed the policy. Representative Martha Roby thanked Pompeo for his stance. Pompeo was reluctant to detail the administration's plan and timeline for releasing an Israeli-Palestinian peace developed by White House advisers Jason Greenblatt and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. He said the proposed plan sought to tackle areas of a Middle East conflict that previous U.S. administrations had failed to resolve. ""Our vision will demonstrate our commitment that we want Palestinians to have a better life as well,"" Pompeo said, adding that he hoped the Palestinians would view the U.S. as a ""fair arbiter."" Pompeo was pressed by Democrat Barbara Lee about proposed cuts in funding to African countries. She said Trump sought cuts of 56 percent to Ghana, 33 percent to Ethiopia, 14 percent to Mozambique, 44 percent to South Sudan, and 71 percent to South Africa, mostly in global health funding. ""This is after a well documented track record of controversial statements from the president identifying certain countries as 's-hole' countries, and quite frankly, attitudes toward the continent in general,"" said Lee. Pompeo pushed back at the criticism, saying the gist of the question was ""in my judgment fundamentally unsound.""

270,True,True,2.0,Reuters,01 May 2019 - 17:12,,Conservatives want Catholic bishops to denounce Pope as heretic,"• Critics cite communion for divorced, abortion, homosexuality. • Francis' stance on religious diversity attacked.","A group of 19 Catholic priests and academics have urged bishops to denounce Pope Francis as a heretic, in the latest ultra-conservative broadside against the pontiff over a range of topics from communion for the divorced to religious diversity. The most prominent of the group is Father Aidan Nichols, a 70-year-old British priest of the Dominican order who has written many books and is one of most recognised theologians in the English-speaking world. The others are less well known. ""We take this measure as a last resort to respond to the accumulating harm caused by Pope Francis's words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the Catholic Church,"" they said in a 20-page open letter. The letter attacks Francis for allegedly softening the Church's stance on a range of subjects. They say he has not been outspoken enough against abortion and has been too welcoming to homosexuals and too accommodating to Protestants and Muslims. It was published on Tuesday by LifeSiteNews, a conservative Catholic website that often is a platform for attacks on the pope. Last year, it ran a document by the Vatican's former ambassador to Washington, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, calling on the pope to resign. A Vatican spokesman had no comment on the letter, which includes dozens of footnotes, Bible verses, pronouncements by previous popes, and a separate bibliography. The letter invites people to join an on-line signature drive. Addressing the bishops, the letter says ""We therefore request that your Lordships urgently address the situation of Pope Francis's public adherence to heresy."" It asks them to ""publicly to admonish Pope Francis to abjure the heresies that he has professed"". Deciding whether a Church member is a heretic is the job of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's doctrinal watchdog department. Massimo Faggioli, a well-known professor of historical theology at Villanova University in the United States, said the letter was an example of the extreme polarisation in the Church. ""There is overwhelming support for Francis in the global Church on one side, and a tiny fringe of extremists trying to paint Francis as a pope who is heretic. The problem is that there is very little legitimate, constructive critique of Francis' pontificate and his theology,"" he said in an email. A significant part of the letter concentrates on ""Amoris Laetitia"" (The Joy of Love), a 2016 papal document that is a cornerstone of Francis' attempt to make the 1.3 billion-member Church more inclusive and less condemning. ULTRA CONSERVATIVES TAKE AIM In it, Francis called for a Church that is less strict and more compassionate towards any ""imperfect"" members, such as those who divorced and later remarry in civil ceremonies. Under Church law they cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex with their new partner, because their first marriage is still valid in the eyes of the Church, unless they have received an annulment. The Church does not allow divorce. Francis has opened the door to some exceptions, allowing the decision whether the person can be fully re-integrated and receive communion to be made by a priest or bishop jointly with the individual on a case-by-case basis. After Amoris Laetitia was published, four conservative publicly challenged the pope, accusing him of sowing confusion on important moral issues. He has thus far not responded to their demands that he clear up their doubts. The new letter lists pages of what it calls ""Evidence for Pope Francis being guilty of the delict (crime) of heresy"". It attacks him for having once said that the intentions of Martin Luther, the father of the Protestant Reformation, ""were not mistaken"". It says he has not condemned abortion strongly enough and is too lenient with homosexual Catholics. The letter criticised Francis for signing a joint statement with Lutherans in 2016 in which the pope said Catholics were grateful for the ""theological gifts"" of the Reformation. It attacked the pope for a common statement with a prominent Muslim leader in Abu Dhabi in February which said the pluralism and diversity of religions was ""willed by God"". Conservatives say the Roman Catholic Church is the only true one and that members are called to convert others to it.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2019-05-01-conservatives-want-catholic-bishops-to-denounce-pope-as-heretic/

The state Senate approved the law by 25 votes to six, rejecting exemptions for cases of rape or incest. It will now go to Republican Governor Kay Ivey. She has not said whether she will sign it, but she is seen as a strong opponent of abortion. Activists hope it will challenge a landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion in the US. The bill had been passed 74-3 earlier this month in Alabama's House of Representatives. Abortion would only be allowed in certain circumstances to safeguard the mother's health. The National Organization for Women called the ban ""unconstitutional"" and said it was ""a transparent effort to drum up political support for anti-abortion candidates in upcoming elections"". Staci Fox of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates called the decision ""a dark day for women in Alabama and across this country"". In a statement she said Alabama politicians would ""forever live in infamy for this vote and we will make sure that every woman knows who to hold accountable"". What do Alabama's politicians say about the new law? Republican lawmaker Terri Collins, sponsor of the legislation, said: ""Our bill says that baby in the womb is a person."" Democratic state Senator Bobby Singleton said the bill ""criminalises doctors"" and is an attempt by men ""to tell women what to do with their bodies"". Republican Senator Clyde Chambliss, a backer of the law, said it would enable the state ""to go directly to the Supreme Court to challenge Roe versus Wade"", the 1973 ruling that established a woman's right to an abortion. Before the debate began, Democrat Rodger Smitherman said: ""We're telling a 12-year-old girl who, through incest and rape is pregnant, we are telling her that she doesn't have a choice."" What does the bill do? It goes further than legislation passed recently elsewhere in the US to ban abortion after a foetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks into a pregnancy. Under the Alabama measure, provision of abortion at any stage in pregnancy would be a class A felony. Doctors could face 10 years in prison for attempting to terminate a pregnancy and 99 years for actually carrying out the procedure. A woman who has an abortion would not be held criminally liable. The bill would allow abortion in cases where the mother's life is at serious risk. Its text says more foetuses have been aborted than people killed in ""Stalin's gulags, Cambodian killing fields"". Why now? Supporters of the legislation have welcomed an inevitable challenge in federal court if the measure becomes law. Pro-choice groups have pledged to take legal action against it. The bill's architects expect it will be defeated in the lower courts, but hope it will end up before the Supreme Court. Their aim ultimately is to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that recognised a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy. Emboldened by the addition of two Trump-nominated conservative justices, anti-abortion activists are eager to take one of the most divisive issues in America back to the highest court in the land. Eric Johnston, founded the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition that helped draft the bill, told NPR: ""The dynamic has changed. ""The judges have changed, a lot of changes over that time, and so I think we're at the point where we need to take a bigger and a bolder step."" What's the national picture? If signed into the law by Governor Ivey, the Alabama measure would become one of more than 300 laws challenging abortion access in the US. Its passage comes amid a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-controlled state capitols around the nation. Legislation to restrict abortion has been introduced in 16 of America's 50 states this year alone, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for more abortion access. The flurry of measures has led these activists to warn that a swathe of US territory could become an ""abortion desert."" At the other end of the political spectrum, a Democratic-sponsored bill in Virginia that would have allowed third-trimester abortions up until the point of childbirth failed to make it out of committee.

Abortion has re-emerged as a central national issue in recent weeks as nine states, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, passed restrictive laws this year that all but outlaw the procedure.

Biden has been the consistent leader in most national and state polls since he first entered the race in late April. Sanders runs second to Biden in most polls.

The poll said Biden showed a sign of potential weakness, with only 29% of those who listed him as their first choice saying they were ""extremely enthusiastic.""

Mr Biden - who said last week he ""detested"" what the segregationists stood for - bristled: ""It's a mischaracterisation of my position across the board. ""I did not praise racists. That is not true."" Ms Harris challenged Mr Biden to disavow his past opposition to bussing in America. He insisted he was only against the policy being mandated by the federal government, but had no problem with its implementation at a state level. Mr Biden also cited his tenure serving two terms as vice-president to Barack Obama, America's first black president. Who else was on stage? Debate-watchers had been expecting a duel between Mr Biden and Bernie Sanders. Mr Biden, a pragmatic centrist, and Mr Sanders, a Democratic socialist, have been battling for the soul of the party as it ponders how best to take on President Trump. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, did dominate the first half hour by defending his plans for free healthcare for all and denouncing Mr Trump as ""a pathological liar and a racist"". Also in the fray was another top-tier contender, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana. The other six on stage have all been polling at one per cent or less: Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Michael Bennet, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, congressman Eric Swalwell, self-help guru Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Where did it all go wrong for Biden? Ms Harris' ambush was not the first time in the debate before a national TV audience of millions that Mr Biden came under attack. The 76-year-old found himself on the defensive early on an issue that he has presented as one of his strengths - political longevity. Mr Swalwell said: ""I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic convention and said, 'It's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.' ""That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation Americans 32 years ago - he's still right today."" Mr Biden, who would be the oldest president ever elected, retorted: ""I'm still holding on to that torch."" The former Delaware senator's debate game plan had been to consolidate his status as the front-runner after recent missteps. He has flip-flopped on abortion and recanted after provoking liberal ire for calling Vice-President Mike Pence ""a decent guy"". But as pack leader, he found himself with a big bullseye on his back. Where did it all go right for Harris? Until now, Ms Harris has failed to match the heavyweights' star power in a crowded Democratic field, though she has remained one of the few top-tier candidates since launching her campaign in January. She soon grabbed the limelight on Thursday night. The mauling of Mr Biden was not her only standout moment. As the debated unravelled at one point into a free-for-all shouting match, she was cheered for saying: ""America does not want to witness a food fight - they want to know how we're going to put food on their table!"" Railing against President Trump at another point, she said with an emphasis on the female pronoun: ""I will ensure that this microphone - that the president of the United States holds in her hand - is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country."" Ms Harris - who is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants - is not without her own political baggage, however. On stage, Mr Biden pointed out he had been a criminal defence lawyer, in a veiled jab at her prior career as a public prosecutor. She has been forced to defend her record as a San Francisco district attorney, amid claims she breached the rights of defendants and opposed criminal justice reforms.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2019-06-28-biden-criticised-over-race-at-democratic-debate/
275,True,True,3.0,[],16 July 2019 - 12:44,,El Salvador: Woman faces retrial after baby died in toilet birth,• El Salvador has some of the world's strictest anti-abortion laws. • Medical experts could not ascertain whether the foetus had died in her womb or just after being born.,"A woman in El Salvador has pleaded not guilty at her retrial to charges of aggravated homicide after her baby died when she gave birth in a toilet. She has said the baby was stillborn, but prosecutors say it was an abortion. El Salvador has some of the world's strictest anti-abortion laws. Evelyn Beatríz Hernández Cruz, 21, had served nearly three years of a 30-year sentence when she was released in February. Following an appeal, a court ordered she be retried, but granted she could live at home during the process. Prosecutors claim she is guilty because she did not seek maternity care, but she maintains that she never knew she was pregnant. ""What Evelyn is living is the nightmare of many women in El Salvador,"" her lawyer Elizabeth Deras told the Associated Press. ""Thank God I'm fine, I'm innocent... I trust God and my lawyers a lot,"" Ms Hernández told the Efe news agency outside court. Dozens of supporters held a protest outside the court near the capital, San Salvador, calling for a change in the legislation. This is the first retrial of an abortion case in El Salvador. The country outlaws abortion in all circumstances, and dozens of women have been imprisoned for the deaths of their foetuses in cases where they said they had suffered miscarriages or stillbirths. There are hopes among human rights groups that the new government of President Nayib Bukele, who took office in June, could usher in a more lenient stance on the issue. The case so far In April 2016, Ms Hernández gave birth at home in a rural area of the Central American country. She lost consciousness after losing large amounts of blood. Her mother told the BBC that police arrived at a hospital while her daughter was receiving treatment. Although she was in the third trimester, Ms Hernández insisted she would have sought medical treatment had she known she was pregnant. In her first trial, she told the court she had been repeatedly raped. Her lawyers said she was too frightened to report the rapes, and some reports said the man who raped her was a gang member. Medical experts could not ascertain whether the foetus had died in her womb or just after being born. Ms Hernández said she had confused the symptoms of pregnancy with stomach ache because she had experienced intermittent bleeding, which she thought was her menstrual period. However, the judge decided Ms Hernández knew she was pregnant. After almost three years, in February she was granted a re-trial with a new judge. Rights organisations in El Salvador says there are still at least twenty other women in jail under the country's strict abortion laws. In the last decade, campaigners have managed to free around 30 through evidence reviews and retrials.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/world/2019-07-16-murder-retrial-for-woman-who-gave-birth-in-toilet/
