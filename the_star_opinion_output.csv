1,True,True,By Françoise Girard,23 February 2016 - 05:00,,Family Planning Will Protect Poor Women From Zika,,"Mosquitoes know no boundaries, and neither does fear. As public health experts grapple with the Zika virus, panic continues to spread around the world. Yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths. The first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become, across Latin America and beyond. This did not happen by chance. In large part, it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to cut social sector expenses, including health spending, beginning in 1980. In Brazil and elsewhere, state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-effective measures to control mosquito-borne diseases, but they did not. Their most affected citizens, who tend to be poor, have been forced to live with the consequences. Second, the Zika epidemic has revealed, with particular poignancy, another dire threat to public health: the denial of women’s reproductive rights. Governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too, often in a grotesque manner. The reported spike in cases of microcephaly – an abnormally small brain – among infants in Zika-affected areas led the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador to warn their women citizens “not to become pregnant”. This message, which places the blame and burden of the Zika epidemic on women, is as unjust as it is unreasonable. It is also toothless, as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions. The Zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality: Not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk. Latin America’s abortion laws are among the world’s most restrictive. El Salvador, for example, bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages, charging them with seeking illegal abortions. Contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region, despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy. The result, especially with the addition of the Zika virus, is a recipe for tragedy. Brazil, the Latin American country hit hardest by the virus so far, is emblematic of the problem: Abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, danger to the woman’s life, or in the case of fetal anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain). In response to the Zika crisis, Brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well. The loosening of restrictions, however, should not stop there. Over the last few years, conservatives in the Brazilian Congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape. These efforts – which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women – must end. Instead, women’s right to seek an abortion should be expanded – and quickly. Governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable. Wealthy Brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions. Poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions, sometimes as part of criminal networks. In September 2014, two women died in Rio de Janeiro following clandestine abortions. In the region overall, 95 per cent of abortions are unsafe. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 62 per cent of women aged 15-49 want to avoid a pregnancy. But nearly a quarter of these women are not using an effective method of birth control. Expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls; another is the lack of information. Men and women need comprehensive sexuality education, so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives. Recent evidence suggesting that Zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available. The movement for reproductive rights has a long history in Brazil and in other parts of Latin America. Over the last several months – even before Zika – feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions. The Zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women’s health and equality. It is certainly a wake-up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems, and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions. Women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying. Françoise Girard is president of the International Women’s Health Coalition.

2,True,True,"Francis Omondi, Kyama Mugambi and Omore C. Osendo",19 May 2016 - 18:00,,The Wabukala Succession: Lessons from Past ACK Archbishops,,"The curtains are closing on the seven-year tenure of the fifth Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK), His Grace The Most Rev (Dr.) Eliud Wabukala. Archbishop Wabukala was elected and thereafter enthroned on July 7, 2009. He retired on account of attaining the age limit for serving in the office. The office of the ACK Archbishop is amongst the most respected and influential religious leaders in the country where he exercises spiritual leadership over the close to six million members and is the official spokesperson of the church on national and international issues. There are six candidates from whom the electors will have to pick the 6th Archbishop: Bishop (Dr). Moses Masamba Nthuka of Mbeere Diocese, Bishop James Kenneth Ochiel of Southern Nyanza Diocese, Bishop Joel Waweru of Nairobi Diocese, Bishop Lawrence Kavutsa Dena of Malindi Diocese, Bishop Jackson Nasoore Ole Sapit of Kericho Diocese and Bishop Julius N. Wanyoike of Thika Diocese. The next Archbishop has five predecessors to learn from. Archbishops Festo Olang, Manasses Kuria, David Gitari, Benjamin Nzimbi and Eliud Wabukala have all served during critical transitions and seasons of the country and have been called upon on different occasions to speak prophetically to the socio-economic and political situations the country has faced. This is coupled with providing l eadership to the Anglican community locally and representation in the global Anglican community gives the Primate a full plate from their first day in office. The first African Archbishop, Rev. Festo Olang, was enthroned in 1970. Archbishop Olang, a man of many firsts in the African Anglican Communion, a protégé of Edward Carey Francis and alumni of Alliance High School hosted the inaugural Anglican Consultative Council in Limuru in 1971. The ACC is more like a global Anglicanism Annual General Meeting. In 1977 he hosted the first conference of African Anglican Bishops that formed into the Conference of Anglican Provinces of Africa (CAPA) and was elected the first Chairman in 1977. However one act that Archbishop Festo Olang did whose effects reverberate to date was the creation of the Dioceses of Maseno North and Maseno South. Until 1971, the only Dioceses were Fort Hall, Mombasa, Nakuru, Nairobi and Maseno. Naturally with the growth of the church comes the creation of new dioceses to make administration better. T he Diocese of Maseno owned or managed the Maseno School, the Maseno Hospital and the St. Phillips Bible College, all established by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) which was the missionary order or wing of the Anglican Church. The division of Maseno Diocese brought about a dispute over which diocese “owned” the three institutions as Maseno town sat right at the border of the two dioceses. The colonial ethnic boundary separating the North Kavirondo (Luhyas) and the Central Kavirondo (Luos) that is at Maseno, is said to have informed the boundary of the Dioceses. In May 2015, the Governor of Vihiga County claimed that Maseno belongs to Vihiga and not Kisumu County, and that they are losing revenue because of this. This has resulted in a border dispute that got the attention of the Speaker following a petition by Luanda MP, Hon. Chris Omulele . During a visit by the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee to Maseno from May 13 – 15, 2 016 to begin resolving the border dispute, elders pointed to the creation of the two Anglican Dioceses as one of the main contributors to the dispute claiming that congregations within the respective dioceses that had pockets of the minority ethnic communities were managed by the Bishop of that community in the bordering diocese. Archbishop Olang retired on his birthday after he convened a Synod meeting for two days after his birthday and he was duly informed that he would be ineligible to preside over it. However the process of electing Archbishop Olang’s successor was deemed as controversial and widely regarded to have been influenced by the then powerful Attorney General Charles Njonjo. In their respective autobiographies, Bishop Okullu and Archbishops Gitari and Kuria give their own account of this transition process pointing to political interference and ethno - political posturing, which has also been witnessed in subsequent elections. Bishop Okullu and Bishop Nzano were the candidates during this election. Archbishop Manasses Kuria was elected and enthroned as the second Archbishop of the Anglican Church in 1980 having served as Bishop of the Diocese of Nakuru from 1976. He served until 1994, 14 of President Moi’s 24 years in office including the one-party state period of 1982 –1990. President Moi’s first six years (1978 - 1984) were perceived by the church as being promising. Moi was faithful in his church attendance that was televised weekly throughout his 24- year presidency. He also ascended to power with the promise to release political prisoners, fight tribalism and corruption, all espoused in the nyayo philosophy of peace, love and unity. However, after the 1982 coup, Moi recoiled and became more hardline politically to deal with growing dissent. From 1985, vocal Anglican bishops like David Gitari, Henry Okullu and Alexander Kipsang Muge together with Nakuru Catholic Bishop Ndingi Mwana-A-Nzeki and the Presbyterian cleric Timothy Njoya mounted a strong campaign against electoral malpractice and human rights abuses. They strongly condemned the change in the electoral system in 1988 from secret ballot to queue voting (mlolongo). Archbishop Kuria actively lent his voice especially when opposition leaders were arrested and detained in 1990. Like the condemnation of civil society and pro-democracy activists today as foreign agents or traitors, the Anglican Church and specifically Archbishop Manasses Kuria and Bishop Okullu were discussed in Parliament in June 1991, with Kuria being described as “a Provincial Administrator” and that the government should “get rid of these characters who are out to breach the peace”. Archbishop David Gitari was enthroned in January 1997 and retired in September 2002, serving the full term of Kenya’s 8 th Parliament. As a young Bishop of Mt Kenya East from 1975, Bishop Gitari preached stinging sermons after the assassination of politician J.M. Kariuki ,in 1989 against queue voting and in 1990 following the assassination of the Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Robert Ouko. Archbishop Gitari’s first year as Archbishop found him in a rather turbulent political period. In the run up to the December 1997 general election, the civil society and the opposition MPs ganged up to press for constitutional reforms that included credible elections and the powers of the presidency. The MPs disrupted the Budget speech in June. In July, church leaders joined the pro-reform group to hold an unlicensed rally that police swiftly disrupted. Protesters seeking refuge at the All Saints Cathedral church were pursued right inside, beaten into a pulp and tear gas canisters were thrown into the church. Archbishop Gitari organized a cleansing ceremony the following week that attracted international attention and global condemnation of what took place there. He preached a famous sermon from Daniel Chapter 5 where he concluded that if the President does not fulfill the wish for a new constitution and respect for human rights, God will write on the State House wall. President Moi ceded and the 1997 general elections saw a rare political agreement between the government and the opposition Members of Parliament, who, through the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG), were able to settle on minimum reforms including the inclusion of more electoral commissioners nominated by opposition parliamentary parties and a revision of the law to give the commission more operational independence. When the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), Archbishop Gitari testified in their Nyeri sitting where he brought up the cases of the murder of J.M. Kariuki and Dr Robert Ouko. Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi was enthroned as the 4th Archbishop of the ACK on September 2002 and served until June 2009. In his enthronement speech, he paid tribute to Retired Archbishop Gitari for his bold leadership, vowing to follow in his footsteps and adapting a famous poem, said: “Gitari ni hodari; Gitari ni daktari; Gitari ni jemedari; Gitari ni hatari” (Gitari is bold; Gitari is a doctor; Gitari is an army commander; Gitari is dangerous). Archbishop Nzimbi started serving at the end of KANU’s reign and throughout President Kibaki’s first term into the 2007 post-election violence period. Naturally the church and the civil society took time to readjust to the new political dispensation led by President Kibaki, often being accused of being slow to point out the ills of a regime that improved the economy and Kenya’s international standing but deepened the ethnic, class and demographic divisions further. The lull in the advocacy role of the church allowed Nzimbi to shift the focus of the church towards expanding missions, promoting evangelisms and engaging society for social transformation; issues he had a passion in since his consecration as the first Bishop of Machakos Diocese in 1985 and the first Bishop of Kitui Diocese in 1995. This saw him oppose the inclusion of abortion related or implied clauses and the proposal to embed Kadhi courts in the draft Constitution during the 2005 referendum. Additionally, Archbishop Nzimbi opposed the acceptance of gay clergy and the blessing of same-sex unions by the Episcopal Church in North America and Canada. In August 2007, Archbishop Nzimbi consecrated two rebel American priests as Bishops under the jurisdiction of the ACK but with oversight over 30 congregations in the US. The priests were opposed to the Episcopal Church’s tolerance of homosexuality. Archbishop Nzimbi became a leading figure in the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans and attended the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) in Jerusalem in 2008 where the Jerusalem Declaration was signed “to declare the tenets of orthodoxy that underpin their identity as Anglicans”. Notably, declaration 8 stated that: “We acknowledge God’s creation of humankind as male and female and the unchangeable standard of Christian marriage between one man and one woman as the proper place for sexual intimacy and the basis of the family. We repent of our failures to maintain this standard and call for a renewed commitment to lifelong fidelity in marriage and abstinence for those who are not married”. The 2005 Constitutional Referendum that split the ruling coalition down the middle, the disputed 2007/8 general election and post election violence that followed was a blot in the country and the church was taken to task for its role in being partisan or not speaking boldly as the country spiraled into ethnic division. Archbishop Nzimbi was instrumental in the mediation process between Raila Odinga and Mwai Kibaki, urging them to open dialogue between themselves and give hope to the people. As the then Chairman of the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya, Archbishop Nzimbi commented that “although religious leaders have been pulled so much by their tribal feelings, they have been working hard together before, during, and after the election asking people to choose peace and prevent chaos”. In October 2008 during the debate on whether to create a special tribunal to try the perpetrators of the violence or whether to provide amnesty to them as part of a healing process, Archbishop Nzimbi supported the full implementation of the Waki Report, rejecting calls for amnesty for perpetrators of crimes. Archbishop Wabukala’s enthronement as the 5th Archbishop of ACK in July 2009 took place when the country was picking up the pieces from the 2007/8 post-election violence. The Constitution Review Process was underway alongside other key reform process including the review of the electoral system and the inquiry into the violence leading to the submission of names of those deemed to hold the highest responsibility over the devastating violence to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague at the end of 2010. Wabukala chaired the ACK’s Constitution Review Commission. During his enthronement service, Archbishop Wabukala laid out the priorities of the church that he intends to focus on, in his charge. On advocacy and national reforms, the Archbishop said that “we will not shy away from speaking out against social ills or pleading the case of the needy and downtrodden. Nevertheless, we will be faithful in praying for our society and its leaders, and where possible we will support and complement the efforts of government and other players in service delivery”. On healing and reconciliation, the Archbishop noted “the unity we should be pursuing should indeed be like that of the three persons of God. The way God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit relate to each other. Their relationship prospers perfectly because it is based on truth, justice and sacrificial love…however brethren, without the truth, unity is at best superficial. At worst it is merely window dressing that is a thin layer of apparent respectability covering situations that are actually toxic”. In May 2010, Archbishop Wabukala speaking on behalf of the Anglican House of Bishops rejected the final revised draft of the Constitution that had been endorsed by Parliament and the Cabinet, citing the refusal for amendments to clauses they did not agree with including the inclusion of Kadhi courts and the permissive stance on abortion. The Archbishop however said congregants were free to participate in the campaigns against the Constitution but the leadership of the church will stay out of the campaigns. Interestingly, Retired Archbishop David Gitari fully supported the new constitution stating that “The draft constitution is democratic and guarantees justice, end of corruption and impunity therefore we cannot be neutral on this matter,” while Wabukala’s immediate predecessor, Retired Archbishop Nzimbi opposed the new constitution stating that “as a matter of conscience he could not support the abortion and Kadhi court clauses.” Wabukala’s tenure as Archbishop (2009 - 2016) coincides with the promulgation of the new constitution in August 2010 that ushers in drastic changes in Kenya’s socio-economic, political and public policy profiles key among them being the introduction of devolution of power and resources, a robust bill of rights, fought for by Archbishops Kuria and Gitari and the ICC process. Education was flagged as one of the priorities in his enthronement charge. The ACK’s involvement in the national curriculum review and convening its own conference on education in March 2016 underscored the importance Archbishop Wabukala places on the matter. However, the traction for an Anglican University seems to have slowed down. The ACK is the only mainstream church that does not have its own university. St Paul’s University in Limuru is jointly owned and sponsored by the Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians. Archbishop Wabukala’s membership in the National Anti-Corruption Campaign Steering Committee (NACCSC), serving, as Chairman in his second term will be judged lately with the high incidences of reporting of corruption scandals. Is this an indication of better access to information, successful whistleblowing or credible public education campaigns by NACCSC? Archbishop Wabukala continued with Retired Archbishop Nzimbi’s consistent and committed stand and participation in GAFCON and was elected the Chair, a role he relinquished in the GAFCON Council in Nairobi April 18th – 22nd . He has particularly maintained a tough stand with regard to dealing with the American Episcopal Church and declined to attend the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) in Lusaka (April 8th – 19th, 2016 ) because of the presence of the Episcopal Church who had earlier in January 2016 been asked to keep off the organs of the Anglican Communion for three years. The Archbishops of Nigeria, Rwanda and Egypt are amongst those who have declined to attend. However, Kenya’s delegation attended and Bishop Joel Waweru, a contender for Archbishop, was elected into the Standing Committee of the ACC.

3,True,True,Ambassador Dmitry Maksimychev,11 November 2019 - 19:40,POPULATION CONFERENCE,Russia: Development is key to addressing population challenges,• The empowerment of women and true equality of the sexes is an integral part of these efforts. • Russia seeks to integrate health and gender considerations practically in every project it funds.,"In the context of the meeting in Nairobi to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo (ICPD+25), I would like to share the Russian perspective and experience on the issue of population and development that we see as an important part of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Russia has consistently supported the full implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action as a general framework for international and national efforts in the field of population and development. The way we see it, the key to the successful implementation of the ICPD Programme is development in all its forms. Only the eradication of poverty, universal access to health and education, creation of livelihoods and opportunities for human development and overall economic growth will make it possible to achieve the goals of Cairo. The empowerment of women and true equality of the sexes is an integral part of these efforts. And, of course, the specificities and economic circumstances of each country must be duly taken into account because it is well known that the one-size-fits-all approach rarely leads to success, and every country has to find its own nationally shaped solutions that would better respond to its needs. In our development assistance measures to contribute to the global achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, in the partnership with the UN development system, we seek to integrate health and gender considerations practically in every project that we fund. Presently, we are considering establishing within the Russia-UNDP Trust Fund for Sustainable Development a new multimillion-dollar window for women’s development. This additional money will be used to expand women’s economic opportunities and create sustainable livelihoods for them in the countries that need our support. Nationally, my country has a long tradition of successfully addressing the problems that are at the centre of the Cairo Programme of Action. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries of the world to recognise and implement equal rights for women (including political, economic and voting rights), to introduce universal free medical service and education up to university level, as well as the right to old-age or disability pensions. At present, we are developing and building on these achievements. Over the last two decades, life expectancy in Russia has increased by eight years and reached 73.7 years (78.5 for women and 68.5 for men). During the same period, the infant mortality rate has been reduced by more than 3.5 times (4.7 per one thousand live births), while maternal mortality has been reduced by five times. The goal is to push life expectancy up to 78 years by 2024 and further to 80 by 2030. These results have been achieved through the implementation of a comprehensive health policy that comprises universal coverage of all citizens by free preventive medical examinations at least once a year and creation of a network of high-tech medical centres. In 2018, the state health budget amounted to 2.6 per cent of the GDP or 2.6 trillion roubles (the equivalent of Sh4.2 trillion), and in 2019, 2.9 trillion roubles (Sh4.7 trillion) or 2.7 per cent of the GDP. In 2020, budget expenditures will be increased by 50 per cent in comparison with 2019. A three-level system of specialised medical care has been introduced for all women and newborns before and during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. The total number of obstetrician-gynaecologists in Russia is approximately 44,000 (5.7 specialists per 10,000 women). In 1920, Russia became the first country in the world to legalise abortions. Every Russian woman has the right to decide to have an abortion up to 12 weeks of the pregnancy. But, because of strong support to women and children, the number of abortions in 2000-19 decreased by two thirds. This is complemented by a strong social policy, which, in its essence, represents an investment in human development. In 2007-18, more than nine million women benefitted from the programme “Maternal Capital” under which every woman who gave birth to or adopted a second or consecutive child is entitled to special financial assistance equivalent to Sh435,000. Every mother in Russia enjoys the right to paid maternity leave and guaranteed return to work to the previous workplace to successfully combine employment with family responsibilities. Every citizen of Russia is entitled to state old age or disability pensions. Forty-four million Russian men and women receive monthly pensions. Full secondary education is free and obligatory. The total number of higher education students is 4.3 million. The level of unemployment in Russia is 4.9 per cent, one of the lowest in the world. Women’s share in the population of Russia is 54 per cent, and women’s share in the Russian labour market is (by sector): 82 per cent in education, 79 per cent in health, 72 per cent in civil service, 69 per cent in finance and insurance, 66 per cent in culture, sports and entertainment. I hope that the Russian experience will be useful in the discussions around the population and development challenges.

4,True,True,ROBERT ASEDA,09 April 2015 - 06:00,,Why The Youth Need Access To Sex Education,,"Young people continue to bear the brunt of challenges facing the globe today, including unemployment, poverty, insecurity and lifestyle diseases. No challenge, however, is more pronounced than reproductive health issues, especially sex education. That the young occupy the largest demographic strata means any nation planning, to be alive and vibrant in the next phase of global development, cannot afford to ignore this vital population. Whereas policy makers and leaders have continued to grapple with how best to handle this the youth in order to harness demographic dividends, no lasting solution has been found. Comprehensive sexuality education is among those strategies that have been thrown at world governments as possible keys to calm the violent youth waters. And whereas some have run away with it, implementation in certain countries has been bogged down by template opposition remarks, religious rhetoric, cultural jingoism and weak political will, keen to play populism in a ruthless elective process. However, one thing that all agree on is that the adolescent isn’t where he or she needs to be. Young people cannot just be statistics in yet another government or civil society organisation report. Young people can be more than the number of female genital mutilation victims, or percentages of teenage pregnancies. They can be more than new HIV-Aids infections or just the number of unsafe abortion cases. They can be just people; people looking forward to a better tomorrow; healthy people waiting to take the world into a new realm of uninterrupted and accelerated global development. However, for that to happen things have to change. After all, it’s only a mad man who keeps on doing the same thing and expecting different results. We can no longer ignore statistics staring us right in the face. According to Google Zeitgeist results, ‘What is sex?’ has featured prominently among the most asked question over the years. What this means is that whereas young people are actively seeking information on their sexuality, they lack a credible centre where they can get all the information they need. In the contemporary setting, the normal parent has to put in extra hours to afford a living for the family and the clergy is still held back by the fear of smearing dirt on the pious altar. Comprehensive sexuality education should not be seen as encouraging sex, neither should it be seen as a foreign concept. It must be seen as an attempt to equip learners with information about benefits of delaying sexual debut and the importance of having safe sexual lives. Especially in the modern age, where young girls no longer troop to their grandmothers’ houses at night to learn how to be women. In 2013, the ministries of Education of Eastern and Southern African countries committed to scale up comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services. This was anchored in the Education Sector Policy of the same year that just outlined the critical role of empowering young people, especially girls, to be able to make well-informed choices. In the momentum of the launch of the ALL IN campaign meant to end HIV-Aids among adolescents, the Kenyan President also made directives to the ministries of Health and Education to end infections among this critical age group. But directives, policy and Acts, though important, aren't the only things required. There’s need to translate our words into actions, our promises into deeds and our commitments into measurable deliverables.

5,True,False,By Odoyo Owidi,20 April 2015 - 06:00,,Raila should learn from Buhari's victory,,"CORD leader Raila Odinga’s presidential bids have an uncanny resemblance to those of Nigeria's new President Muhammadu Buhari. So much so that many of Raila's supporters foresee him winning the 2017 general election, which he will be contesting at the same age (72) as Buhari is today and for the same number of times (third). Buhari is believed to have been propelled to victory due to the spiralling corruption in the Nigerian government and failure by outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan to tame Boko Haram. The situation is similar to our list of shame and al Shabaab, though President Uhuru Kenyatta has acted early enough and better than Goodluck on both issues. Buhari and Odinga have both been accused of leading coups. Both are seen as firm and decisive by their supporters and ruthless and dictatorial by their detractors. Both Buhari and Odinga have been heads of government; Buhari through a coup and Odinga through a power-sharing agreement precipitated by post-election violence. Both have therefore had an opportunity to be gauged by voters on what they can do with power. All these notwithstanding, Raila Odinga can still learn from Buhari’s victory. First and most important is media management. Buhari’s social media campaign team was attractive and convincing to friend and foe. Our brothers here have thrown persuasion out the window. They throw insults at all those who do not agree with their positions and see moles paid by their opponents everywhere. A look at Buhari’s social media campaigns reveals a group of well-paid professionals whose sole objectives was to convert non-believers, unlike our bunch of fanatical volunteers who respond to every opposition with emotional outbursts and aims only to please fellow believers. As for the mainstream media, I must advise the Odinga team that it is not enough to have gatekeepers in media houses to block negative stories and oppose comments, which are a necessary window to alternative thinking. Raila Odinga should appreciate ability, eligibility, and credibility. We have had situations where his preferred candidates and agents are almost illiterate in the very tasks they are expected to perform. Buhari had majority of his agents as professionals with university degrees and beyond. Here, we go for sycophancy disguised as loyalty. Baba needs to appreciate institutions and let his party work as an institution advising him, instead of him advising the party, thus limiting contributions from experts. Buhari went as far as announcing the funds raised for his campaigns, how much was used, what balance was left and what it was to be used for. He was seen to be transparent. Today, ODM has not made public what criterion it used to arrive at the list of its national officials nor the party candidates from the constituencies, in which the nominations were called off or aborted in the 2013 general election. Baba should tame the arrogant people around him. They behave as if they own both him and the party, and they decide who becomes what and when. They often tell Kenyans on national media, without the slightest of guilt, that Baba owns the party and can do as he wishes with ‘his’ party. Baba’s relatives must appreciate and practise modesty. Buhari’s family surrendered him to the people of Nigeria and sat back to watch what they do with him. Buhari tackled real issues that affected the people of Nigeria without sugar-coating or juxtaposition. He admitted that the incumbent president had tried, something that Baba has never done. He did not hoodwink them with fantasies and unrealistic promises that are not practical. Buhari never waited to be president to help his people. With the little influence he had, he greatly developed his community and even introduced an education kitty that saw thousands of needy students get educated without much toil. Raila on the other hand has watched as his community sinks into poverty year after year despite his local and international influence. He is a regular traveller to rich and powerful countries of the world, where past and present African leaders source for scholarships and development projects for their people. I suspect that the low voter turnout in his strongholds is due to voters who can’t stand the way he does his things yet cannot vote for his opponent. The recent dismal turnout during the Homa Bay by-election was no accident, and neither was Kajiado’s impressive turnout. If Baba wins the presidency, it will be for all Kenyans, whether they supported him or not, whether their communities had ruled before or not, whether they are already rich or not, whether they are in the list of shame or not. So any favour to his supporters must come now and not when he becomes president.

6,True,False,By Timothy Bosire,21 April 2015 - 07:00,,Does Jubilee want to drown this country?,,"Everybody is mourning! Our innocent students were brutally butchered at a University in Garissa last week due to a failed security system. The failure was occasioned by incompetence of a misfiring executive that seized power through propulsion by other extraneous forces other than their own suitability nor capacity. Tribalism, ICC and vested interests of the status quo conspired to condemn us to suffer failed leadership! The poor children whose only sin was being in school to train and acquire knowledge and skills to serve their country and humanity add to victims of other brutal massacres at Westgate, in Mpeketoni , Mandera Quarry, Mandera bus attack, Kapedo and forth. For all those deaths the government has only offered condolences and Public Relations speeches hoping to calm our bitterness and anger. It is like an irresponsible parent who gives candy to his or her child crying out for food when very hungry or for quick rescue from deep trouble. It is an insult. Add to these the victims of illicit brews, victims of floods thousands of road accident victims due to poor traffic management on our roads, those succumbing to Cancer, cholera and mothers and infants dying during birth in remotes parts of the country. All are victims of Jubilee’s bad governance. “Clueless” could be second name of this regime. Its reign from day one has been punctuated by lethargy, inertia and costly blunders. So much such that it’s continued being in power is a mere happenstance accorded by constitutional gaps that allow incompetents to cling on.Indeed accidental leadership. Isn’t it ironical that the Jubilee Coalition is busy reorganizing itself for re-election in 2017 at a time when it should be throwing in the towel for letting down Kenyans? They are busy cobbling together the Jubilee Alliance Party of David Murathe and company claiming that it is an effort towards consolidating their Unity in order to win the 2017 race conclusively. Yet the right thing to do is to resign in shame and apologise for exposing the country to calamities and anguish. Isn’t theirs a conspiracy against the constitution and the people? Which patriot can unite in defence of a regime that is incompetent, dysfunctional, tribal and corrupt? Wouldn’t it be wise to unite with other progressive forces to democratically send home this disgraceful outfit? Won’t re-electing Jubilee be willful self destruction? Who will have remained by 2017 to vote for JAP if they have mismanaged national security agencies, making them unable to stop al Shabaab, bandits, cattle rustlers and marauding gangs who butcher Kenyans at will? Which voter will be there when they have undermined the proper devolution of health services to the counties, hence allowing manageable communicable diseases (eg cholera) to depopulate some parts of the country killing helpless citizens? Who will vote when drug abuse and alcoholism has been allowed to finish the youth? But the story is bigger and more grim! Talking of Jubilee failures, one needs to write a whole book or unleash a one week Television documentary. Jubilee epitomizes failed governance, costly political guess work, criminal negligence and gross abuse of democratic governance. The ruling coalition has almost deliberately failed to do anything about implementing their manifesto. Virtually all their flagship projects have run into false starts due to corruption or incompetence in attempted procurement. Others were just too ambitious and pieces of fantasy used during elections to cheat gullible voters. They include the schools laptops programme, five modern sports stadia across the country, one million acres of farmland under irrigation, expansion of the road network in rural Kenya, modern housing for police and civil servants, modernisation of the security services (eg more officers, better tools and better accommodation), expansion of quality education (primary, tertiary and higher), secured national borders, eradication of corruption, industrialisation, job creation, youth and women's empowerment and introduction of a 24 hour economy. Instead of implementing their manifesto and the new constitution, which is mandatory, the government has immersed itself in defeatist ventures, including undermining the rule of law, reintroducing tribalism in public appointments, liberalizing official corruption, frustrating democracy, killing the civil society, reintroducing draconian laws and destroying the constitutional order in the country. The Executive’s penchant for disobeying court orders and rulings marks the height of dictatorship, impunity and attempts at distorting the constitutional order. The retention of the discredited provincial administration and the President’s recent attempt to instruct the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett to admit to training 10,000 recruits whose hiring is a dispute in court was the worst. The law prohibits the IG from getting instructions from the Executive and also no one has authority to interfere with a matter in court. The attempt aborted but it was the latest attempt at pushing for the reign of “one man rule” as jubilee enthusiasts aspire.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2015-04-21-does-jubilee-want-to-drown-this-country/
7,True,False,NGUNJIRI WAMBUGU,04 May 2015 - 10:30,,Cord's Okoa Kenya Bill Is A Huge Joke,,"I finally got a chance to read through the Okoa Kenya bill as proposed by CORD and their political associates. What I can say right from the start is that this bill is purely about politics. It has no ideas on how to improve gender balance, human rights, governance, empower the youth, create employment etc. The bill also has absolutely nothing in it on how to cure security and corruption; two major challenges that Kenya is struggling with, and which Cord mischievously uses to fight the Jubilee government all the time. Unfortunately even the political ideas they have suggested are fatally flawed. For example Cord argues that it wants to strengthen devolution, then slyly introduce two additional levels of devolution; ward and constituencies. What Cord is trying to do is use the constituency and ward funds idea to attract MCAs and MPs to support Okoa Kenya. However this essentially changes Kenya’s devolution structure from two levels to four, and introduces these two additional levels of public expenditure with no solutions on how to ensure accountability of the funds. (Of course we do not expect the MPs and MCAs to ensure such accountability). Cord has also suggested that 5% of revenue from natural resources be allocated to local ‘communities’. The idea is to attract communities where minerals and oil are being discovered to support the bill. Cord then suggests that such communities establish a ‘representative community management framework’ to receive and administer these monies. Essentially Cord is proposing that the indigenous tribes in regions with natural resources organize themselves so as to receive money for resources found in their regions. What they deliberately ignore is that this will automatically increase inter-ethnic conflict as some ‘communities’ remove ‘strangers’ to ensure they keep everything without sharing with 'others'. Cord is basically promoting ethnic cleansing. Staying on tribalism; Cord also suggests that no single community should have more than 15% representation in national government, or in private government contractor companies. This is meant to mobilize other communities against the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities who are perceived to be overly represented in national government. However what I cannot understand is how the Okoa Kenya Chairman (Paul Mwangi) can sell an idea that discriminates against his own community! Kikuyus are obviously more than 15% of the total Kenyan population. Is Paul (and Cord) telling us that they do not deserve to have proportionate representation in government? But the most fatal flaw in the bill is about money. In 2013/2014 the government allocated approximately 27 per cent of the national budget to education, 23 percent to energy, infrastructure and ICT, and 19% to Defense, Interior and National Intelligence. This comprised of close to 70% of the total budget. However the national government also needs to fund the Judiciary, Parliament, IEBC, Foreign Policy/Affairs (maintain embassies, manage foreign policy, coordinate international trade, etc), etc. Amazingly Cord believes all thse can be done with 55% of the national government! Maybe they need to tell us what we should do away with ... security, education, judiciary; or maybe elections. Then they go ahead and suggest a referendum everytime we need to change allocation percentages! There are a lot more ridiculous ideas in what is quite a small bill. Cord suggests that we force IEBC to register 80% of all registered voters per region; create a rotational IEBC chairman structure that limits each chair’s term to 12 months, and increase the presidential petition period to 90 days, with another 60 days set aside for a re-election in case of a successful appeal. What they do not explain is what the majority of Kenyans will be doing as the minority political class spend 5 months in legal and political battles about who will be the next President. Incidentally do the one million Kenyans whose signatures Cord collected know what they appended their signatures to? *** My terrorism note for this week. Hon Aden Duale and his team of 40 Somali political leaders should not think that we have forgotten the 30-day promise to provide names of terrorist financiers and sympathizers in the region/community. I also expect these 40 leaders to lead in calls for an audit of the Kenyan population in the former North Eastern province. Unless they also want to insist ther a natural explanation for a 140% population increase in the region in 10 years. *** Finally, April has been a very tough month for President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Garissa attack, police recruitment executive order, list of 175 corruption suspects versus the EACC leadership drama, the parastatal appointments, aborted plane trip, etc. We would love to blame the people around the President, but we know he is the one keeping them there. A silver lining. There is enough time to fix things, assuming he wants to serve two terms. *** Ngunjiri is a Director of Change Associates, a Political think Tank",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2015-05-04-cords-okoa-kenya-bill-is-a-huge-joke/
8,True,False,AMINA MOHAMED,01 June 2015 - 08:00,,Africa On Right Trajectory On Development,,"Kenya is alive to the ideals of pan-African visionaries — Jomo Kenyatta, Haile Selassie, Kwame Nkrumah, Muammar Gaddafi, Malcom-X and WEB Du Bois — who laid the foundation for the liberation and unity of our continent. We have been pursuing an Afro-centric foreign policy which places our engagement with African countries at the apex of our diplomatic engagement. We are keen supporters of the African agenda and are fully committed to ensuring its realisation. Africa has come a long way. Despite the optimism that greeted the dawn of independence championed by the OAU, 10 years later Africa began to slide into 'the lost decades'. The 1980s and 1990s were characterised by economic stagnation, poverty, hunger and dictatorships as well as by violent conflicts in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Great Lakes as epitomised by the genocide in Rwanda. This period gave rise to Afro-pessimism justified in terms of diseases, civil wars, famine, and corruption that ravaged Africa. Around this time, a world famous publication described Africa as a lost cause, a hopeless continent. Indeed, the interest of the world shifted from the continent to the Eastern European economies then transiting to free markets and also to the then emerging dynamic economies of South East Asia. Yet rarely is a situation so irredeemable. In retrospect, these tumultuous times generated serious conversations nationally and within the OAU which, at length, informed the political and economic transformation we are witnessing. Today, Africa is being hailed as the rising continent. Economies are booming, peace prevails in most countries, democratization has taken root, and foreign investors are all over Africa looking for opportunities. Challenges remain, however. The continent remains fragmented, poverty and disease still abound, jobs are not being created fast enough, and there are skills and infrastructure gaps to address. Moreover, pockets of violent conflict persist while terrorism is threatening to not only erode the progress that has been made but to also abort the dream of the African renaissance. There is therefore considerably much that remains to be done to sustain the process of transformation. It is encouraging that the AU has risen to the occasion and is providing leadership. In particular, the development and adoption of Agenda 2063, which is Africa’s blue print for sustainable development in the next 50 years, is a remarkable step forward. The Agenda 2063 has outlined necessary steps to realising the African renaissance. First, the integration of the continent must be accelerated. The level of intra-African trade remains the smallest compared to intra-regional trade in other parts of the world. With must move with a sense of urgency to put in place the necessary measures that will facilitate the free movement of peoples and goods. Integration will also strengthen Africa’s voice and enhance bargaining power at the global stage. Africa needs the world, as the world needs Africa. Secondly, African countries need to ensure economic sustainability, especially as regards infrastructure and skills base. African countries everywhere are constrained by limited availability of energy, high transport costs and limited connectivity. We need to improve cross-border infrastructure particularly transport corridors, maritime ports that are efficient, railways, airports and broadband connectivity. With respect to skills, Africa has the youngest population in the world with a lot of energy, creativity and talent. Investment in their education and training, more particularly in science, technology, research, and innovation, remains critical for Africa’s modernization and development. Finally, African countries must ensure equitable development. Economic growth that leaves out large sections of the populace is a recipe for conflict. A sense of fairness and equity generates a strong basis for political legitimacy. We must therefore deliberately move in the direction of creating stakeholder economies in which everyone has a stake. This will also help in stemming radicalization and terrorism that feeds on economic discontent.

9,True,True,ERIC GITARI,08 July 2015 - 05:00,,Mozambique Sets An Example On Gay Issue,,"While much global attention has been on the US Supreme Court ruling allowing equal marriage, many in the African continent have been celebrating a revised legal code that decriminalised homosexuality in Mozambique last Tuesday. Mozambique becomes the latest African country to decriminalise consensual same-sex sexual relations through Parliament. In a rare move by African parliamentarians, Mozambican lawmakers last December approved the amended legal code, which removed the colonial-era anti-gay law from 1886 that had been described as “very vague”. Former President Joaquim Chissano is among those who publicly supported efforts to decriminalise homosexuality in the former Portuguese colony. Other African countries that have had the same precedent in decriminalising homosexuality include Sao Tome and Principe and Lesotho which legalised homosexuality in 2012. Cape Verde decriminalised consensual same-sex sexual relations in 2004. Consensual adult same-sex sexual relations remain illegal in Egypt, Gambia, Cameroon, Kenya, South Sudan, Zimbabwe and more than two dozen other African countries. Those found guilty of homosexuality in Mauritania, Sudan and portions of Nigeria and Somalia face the death penalty. In Kenya, the government tabled a report in Parliament in March 2014 showing that between 2010 and February 2014, Kenya had dealt with 595 cases of homosexuality within its criminal justice system. The latest known homosexual prosecution was in February 2015 in Kwale county, where two young adult men are still facing charges of consensual sex against the order of nature and an alternative charge of indecent acts between adults in private. In 2014 alone, I and a team of lawyers attended tens of cases where men were charged with indecency with other men in private. This is illustrative of the depth of anti-gay prosecution and often persecution that is vile in Kenya, away from the media. Mozambique, just like Kenya, had its anti-gay laws and anti-abortion laws introduced by the colonial masters who also introduced their religion to reinforce the ‘laws against immorality’. It was a turnaround moment for Mozambique to have colonial-era anti-gay and anti-abortion laws reversed within the week the country was celebrating 40 years of independence. Quite a ceremony of sovereignty. The Parliament of Mozambique was guided by facts and an understanding of the heritage of its people as regards to sexual freedom and the respect for dignity. It was a sovereign act to revise colonial laws policing sexuality only to the extent of retaining laws that punish non-consensual sex, including sexual exploitation of children. Our legislators ought to endeavor to use this precedent to guide Kenyans in the face of growing anti-gay crusade ahead of US President Barack Obama’s visit. The African Union has expressed its view on this matter through the ACHPR Resolution 275, which prohibits violence and discrimination on grounds of real or imputed sexual orientation and gender identity in Africa. This resolution asks states to enact legislation to punish such violent acts and to reform laws that justify the same. Kenya has been on such a hype on pan-Africanism, especially splinting on the anti-ICC crusade, it should lead in implementing this resolution through repealing section 162-165 of the penal code, which excuse homophobia. As Parliament was told by the majority leader last year, this anti-gay law punishing consensual adult same-sex is impossible to prosecute without constitutional breaches to privacy and equality. Why are we still maintaining an archaic British Victorian law in our post-constitutional dispensation? Is it not time Parliament reviewed these laws to align them with the constitution by liberating adult consensual sex in private and punish sexual violence, paedophilia, bestiality, sexual trafficking, slavery and exploitation? Additionally, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the National Aids and STI Control Programme have produced scientific research clearly showing the harm of criminalising homosexuality to the public health of the general population. Criminalisation drives people underground and reduces access to comprehensive sex education on HIV and STI prevention. This then translates to a huge population of sexually active persons engaging in risky sexual practices without knowledge. Health Cabinet Secretary James Macharia was cited last year indicating that as many as 60 per cent of men having sex with other men are in heterosexual marriages and have children. How many of them have comprehensive knowledge of safe sex with other men? How many married men are having unprotected sex with other men without knowing the risk? How many bisexual or gay men and women are we going to force into societal respectability through convenient heterosexual marriages that are harming their mental health and that of their spouses and children? The decriminalisation debate then becomes beyond equality for gays and lesbians and transcends to enhancing legal and policy structures to healthier families and a healthier nation. Countries that have removed laws that perpetuate stigma and hatred of others have witnessed increased human potential development and cohesiveness in society. We have not seen any evidence of population reduction or increased paedophilia due to legalisation of homosexuality as some have argued. We need to move from building our nation based on divisive emotional points and embrace factual evidence and empirical data that guides us to our shared path of understanding, peace and development along durable lines. Let us get sober on this gay debate and learn from Mozambique’s example.

10,True,False,JILL COTTRELL GHAI,01 August 2015 - 06:00,,Why Governments Do Not Like Access To Information,,"Our constitution says – “35. (1) Every citizen has the right of access to —…(a) information held by the State; and …(3) The State shall publish and publicise any important information affecting the nation.” This has been written about in Katiba Corner before, but it is really brought into focus when we see how governments may dislike it. So now which government dislikes it? The Independent newspaper in the UK says the freedom of information in that country is under “major attack” from the government. Why is it important? The Independent introduced its coverage with the following (edited to be hopefully meaningful to Kenyan readers): In the past 10 years, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act (FoI), the British public has become aware of many important facts of which we would otherwise have remained ignorant. We have learnt about cracks in the nuclear reactor at (a major nuclear power station). We have learnt about police using Tasers against children, hospitals incinerating aborted foetuses, …. (The police explain “Tasers”: they deliver “a sequence of very short high voltage pulses that result in the loss of voluntary muscle control causing the subject to fall to the ground or freeze”. Other sources report they cause considerable pain.) We have learnt about the killing of Afghan civilians by British troops, and about the bullying with which (a now dead MP)discouraged police from investigating his sexual abuse of children. Without FoI, we would never have known about the Prince of Wales’s lobbying of ministers, or about the scandal of MPs’ expenses. (The expenses claim issue was about what seemed to be excessive, and sometimes dishonest claims by MPs. The problem with the Prince of Wales (the next King) is that the monarch is supposed to be strictly neutral on policy issues.) This week we learnt that, despite Parliament having voted against it, UK armed forces have taken part in air strikes against targets in Syria. And now – guess what? – the Government has set up a commission, with a view to ushering in the end of FoI. It will not be hard for Kenyans to see analogies in Kenya to the sorts of revelations The Independent pinpointed. Do we know enough about the safety of buildings and what is done to ensure it? Do we know how and why the police manage to kill so many people? Do we understand how so many prominent people suspected of criminal offences manage never to appear before the courts? Do we know enough about what Kenyan troops are doing in Somalia? Do we know what individual MPs claim as expenses? You can see how useful this can be for achieving accountability of government to the people – the government itself has to provide the information, so at least it should not be able to deny the facts. And the constitution attaches great importance to accountability – and to the transparency that is needed for accountability. It also tries to ensure that the government is legally liable for its misdeeds by making it much easier to bring cases in court against the government for breach of the constitution. Though court rules usually require each side to reveal the evidence they have once a case has started, it may be impossible to start a case at all because the facts are unknown. FoI can help with this. But information is also vital if that other important constitutional value – public participation – is to mean anything. The national government, and county governments, are busy developing policies, laws and guidelines about participation. But this can be a façade – in fact a fraud – if people do not understand what they are being asked for their opinions about, why certain ideas are suggested and what the alternatives are. The right of access to information can be used to make participation real. Why governments may not like FoI is not hard to see, but how may they resist? The British government is not about to repeal the Freedom of Information Act, and, indeed it insists it wants to remain (as it says it is) the “most transparent in the world”. But it has appointed a commission to decide whether the balance between transparency and accountability on one hand and the protection for “sensitive information” on the other is right, whether more secrecy needs to be given to policy discussions and advice, and whether FoI imposes too heavy a “burden” on public authorities. As The Independent comments “The case for strengthening the Act is not on the agenda”. The UK Act provides that usually material relating to ongoing policy discussions will not be released, but once a decision about policy is made, disclosure may be ordered if it is in the public interest. This, a columnist in the newspaper comments, is what the government does not like. Removing this possibility of public interest disclosure would, he says, “keep all internal discussion secret for 20 years, even if it showed serious mistakes. This would not be just turning the clock back; it would be pulling off the hands and chucking them away.” And the newspaper also suggests that two of the five people appointed to carry out this review are rather likely to be hostile to the Act (one being among the MPs criticised for expense claims revealed as a result of FoI). In Kenya, the right of access to information cannot be done away with – it is in the constitution. But it can be limited by law, and we already have a lot of law that does that. To make the right really effective there should be a set of procedures for getting access to information. Draft laws on this have been around for several years, and ministers have made much of the fact that law is coming, but so far it has not been presented to Parliament. Resistance of politicians and others to making public the assets that must be declared explains why neither the constitution nor the Public Officers’ Ethics Act requires such public declaration – common in many countries. And one of the few mechanisms for transparency that we do have – the Auditor General – faces major obstacles. Every year the Auditor General provides detailed reports on what happens to public money. He has just done so for county governments, with devastating comments that ought to cause the individuals fingered to slink off the public stage, never to return. But this is true every year – and what happens? And some wanted to defange the Auditor General even more, by enacting laws that would require publication of the AG’s reports only after approval by Parliament (or a county assembly). This did not appear in the final Audit Bill as published, but there are limits on publication of reports on security related issues that may enable serious misuse of public money to go without the sunlight of publicity that public audit is supposed to provide. It would be foolish to pretend that FoI always achieves results. Maybe government offices don’t keep good records, and cannot supply information. And we can see the shortcomings from the way the UK government managed to shrug off three FoI requests for records about colonial treatment of the Mau Mau. And to get Prince Charles’ letters released the Guardian newspaper had to fight the government right through the court system, and overall it took them 10 years to get the letters. But FoI has had beneficial effects in many countries. It can begin to change the attitudes of public officers from one of secrecy to more acceptance of openness. And acceptance of openness may even change work behaviour. If there was a more serious risk that your inefficiencies and worse might be uncovered, wouldn’t you perhaps think twice about the way you behave? The courts have held that before going to court, citizens must ask for information. Don’t we need a campaign to start asking?

11,True,True,ODOYO OWIDI,03 August 2015 - 05:45,,ODM not playing to win presidency in 2017 elections,,"ODM recently announced its grassroot party elections to be carried out in a staggered manner from August 1, starting with a cluster of counties including Migori, Wajir, Kajiado, Kilifi, Marsabit and Vihiga. However, after Obama left the country, the party announced that the elections have been postponed because civic education could not be carried out in the counties dominated by Muslims during Ramadhan. Never mind that there was no formal voter education carried out in Migori, Kajiado and Vihiga either. Nevertheless, before the postponement, ODM chairman John Mbadi announced that non-ODM loyalists from Migori and their supporters will not be allowed to contest any party seat at any level. He singled out Governor Okoth Obado and Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno. In other words, Mbadi has expelled these politicians and their supporters from the party through the backdoor. The same door through which Mbadi became the chairman at a Naivasha meeting that was subsequently rubber-stamped at Bomas by a similarly irregular list of delegates. It is still fresh in our memory how the party master-minded the abortion of its own elections at Kasarani and later used the same method in a by-election nomination in Homa Bay. After these two entertaining fiascos, there was apology from no less than the party leader. Recently, at the memorial service for his mother-in-law in Migori county, party leader Raila Odinga praised Obado, saying he is an ODM member who only defected after the shambolic nominations. Suddenly Mbadi has conveniently contradicted his boss. Mbadi is not known to even be able to chase a fly off the coat of Raila, and with this in mind, it can only be said Obado may have been short-changed. The praise must have been informed by a momentary good gesture. Maybe he had generously helped in organising the function that was in his county. Should that be the case, I would conclude that in matters ODM, Obado is a slow learner. It is important that the party leadership consisting of Mbadi and director of political affairs Opiyo Wandayi are reminded that a vote, like money, retains its value irrespective of where it has come from. A vote never loses its value because it is from a Jubilee supporter. Equally important, these principal sycophants must know that these people they are locking out of the party have supporters whose votes 'Baba' will need. Obado beat ODM candidate Akong'o Oyugi fair and square in the 2013 elections, despite Baba's spirited campaigns in Migori, at a time when he should have been looking for presidential votes outside Luoland! Dalmas Otieno won for Kanu 10,000 plus votes in Rongo constituency at a time when Kanu had the lowest support in Luo Nyanza. With this in mind, I conclude that these party mandarins have no intention of helping Raila win the presidency at all. All they want is to get themselves re-elected through the only sure method they know—maximum sycophancy. ODM has become a private club of friends and relatives masquerading as a political party just to keep a community hoping for the ultimate prize—the Presidency. ODM would rather have the Luo remain loyal than win the presidency. They would rather chase away votes than lose the grip they have on this hapless community. Most of the party's actions are not meant to win votes for the party’s candidate but rather to keep the Luo electorate believing in the impossible cause of Raila winning the presidency in 2017. Why would a serious party use a strategy that had been previously used by their opponent? Why is this ODM strategy of ‘register for IDs, get voters cards and elect Baba’ only hyped in Luo Nyanza, a community with a possible maximum of three million votes out of a possible maximum of 22 million votes countrywide? Why would a party wanting to win an election still want to exclude potential voters? We all know that the government is the greatest employer and business partner anywhere in the world yet ODM is a party that believes anyone who seeks anything from the government is a ‘mole’. A community that does not do business within the government nor get government employment is bound to lag behind in development and wealth creation and may be unable to wage any meaningful future political wars. Unless the primary aim of ODM is to ensure that nobody else will be able to wage a presidential campaign from Luoland after Raila. ODM must be told that’s its unwritten but well enforced policy of ‘keep off the government of the day’ is retrogressive and must be rejected by all well-meaning members. It only serves the purpose of making the people difficult to govern but easy to enslave.

12,True,True,ANN KIOKO,01 April 2016 - 05:00,,It’s the West’s Agenda To Control Our Population,,"Gay activists in Kenya have not made any strides in their campaigns to homosexualise Kenyan and African people, they should thus stop lying to their financiers by presenting skewed statistics and reports. While it is true that a few highly westernised people who have been masquerading as homosexuals have managed to make one or two media and court appearances, it is untrue to claim that in Kenya or any of 53 African countries (minus South Africa), people have successfully been “homosexualised.” Most Kenyans believe in families and see homosexuality as the greatest threat to functional family units. e Kenyan constitution already allows human rights for everyone including any seemingly ‘special group’, so it is extremely selfish for them to demand gay rights. We are a God-fearing country and the Bible is clear that God created a man and a woman. Those caught practising sodomy in the Bible were punished by God and it is unfortunate now that we are having the same sinners demanding special rights. They try to be a bit liberal and argue on the basis of genetics, but renowned doctors have refuted this claim and argued that homosexuality is not genetic. It is a learned behaviour which comes through socialisation and interaction. In other cases some people do it to be paid. It is true that some Western countries have vowed to make sure Africa embraces homosexuality. I sought the opinion of my 97-year old granny, who was surprised to learn homosexuality now exists in Africa. She said marriage has never been between two men or two women since time immemorial. It was an abomination to even think of it in her early years. “ These people must have been imported the other day because I have never come across them before.” We are under immense pressure to create liberal laws that allow same-sex unions and abortion. The agenda is to control the population because a big one is a threat to the West in many respects. Homosexuality can be a great tool to control population growth as it is the only sure way to have a ‘baby-less’ union. Every child needs a father and a mother, not two daddies or two mums. God created each gender uniquely and none can play the role of the other, no matter how hard they try. Besides dysfunctional couples, homosexuality exposes those that practice it to health and mental issues. Kenyans and Africans in general are very gracious though. They pray a lot for offenders, and the tonnes of prayers being directed to this item in particular are massive to a level that I am sure homosexual acceptability will not see the light of day. We love even the few sold out souls and will pray that they find their way back to normalcy. We will also very soon identify the Western sponsors of these campaigns and shame them.

13,True,False,By Ngunjiri Wambugu,11 April 2016 - 05:00,,Cord Will Fall Before 2017,,"Let me start with three uncomfortable truths about Kenya’s presidential elections. One, since the introduction of multi-party politics in 1992 the Presidential vote has been decided on tribal lines. The exception was 2002 and was because the two top candidates were from the same ethnic group. Two, each of these elections has been determined by seven tribes; the Kikuyus, Luyhas, Kalenjins, Luos, Kambas, Kisii and Meru, who together make up 75% of Kenya’s population. Three, since we embraced multiparty politics every election where an incumbent has been defending his seat has had some sort of violence. However whereas in the first two such elections (1992 and 1997) there was what has been referred to as ‘controlled violence’ in ‘defense’ of the incumbent, the violence in 2007 was instigated by the opposition against government. In the 2013 elections the seven communities above were clothed in different political parties. TNA was for the Kikuyu; URP for the Kalenjin; Wiper for the Kamba, Ford-Kenya and Amani for the Luhya, ODM for the Luo, APK for the Meru and Ford-People for the Kisii. As we head into the 2017 elections the tribal political formations are still the same though they are organized under two main coalitions; Jubilee, which is in government; and Cord, which is the opposition. Today three of the seven communities; the Kikuyu, Meru & Kalenjin; are formally organized under Jubilee and ready to defend their incumbency in 2017. The other four; the Luo, Luhya, Kamba and Kisii are organized as opposition and are meant to challenge Jubilee. However the opposition coalition is struggling to stay together as shown by Moses Wetangula’s aborted presidential launch a few weeks ago. As we head into 2017 there are several things we must expect. One, Jubilee will stay together up to 2017. This is primarily due to the collapse of the ICC case against Ruto this week. They are also in charge of government so they have more opportunities to keep everyone in the coalition happy. Two, Cord will collapse before 2017. This is because they have only one position to compete for; the running mate and deputy presidency. (I think only a child would believe that the opposition presidential candidate will be anyone else but Raila Odinga). I can bet that once one of the two main tribal formations in the opposition gets the running mate position, the others will leave, and most probably into Jubilee. Three, Jubilee will leverage Cord’s fall-out. This is because Jubilee needs at least one more of the seven communities to guarantee a win. Jubilee also needs to win in the first round if we are to ensure that the opposition does not instigate political violence. I therefore expect Jubilee to create opportunities to entice one or two of the other communities in Cord, to their side. For example the Nairobi tribal arithmetic are such that if the Kikuyu decide to support either a Luhya or Kamba candidate for Nairobi governor, it’s a done deal. Four, the Opposition cannot win the 2017 elections. The four communities that make up Cord cannot mobilize enough numbers to get 50%+1 of the presidential vote. However they can stop Jubilee from winning in the first round, instigate political violence as we head into the run-off and force a coalition government. This worked in 2007 and it’s the only way they can get into government. All they need is to ensure that they delegitimize any institution that could resolve a political dispute in 2017. This is Kenya's political outlook as we head into 2017.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2016-04-11-cord-will-fall-before-2017/
14,True,True,OKECH KENDO,20 April 2016 - 05:00,,We're On A New Path To Hate,,"The power elite are clashing over the bungled International Criminal Court cases, as victims of political intrigues mourn the abortion of justice. What should have been a time of reflection is a moment of hubris for the power elite. Life is not fair — perhaps it was not intended to be. Instead of learning from the miscarriage of justice in humility, ‘our leaders’ are setting the country on a renewed hate trajectory. Worse, this is happening a few months to another general election year. Instead of working for free and fair elections next year, the country is stuck with a discredited electoral commission, one whose leadership exhibited astounding bias during the presidential election petition at the Supreme Court in 2013. The immediate trigger of the 2007-08 post-election violence was a bungled presidential election. The power elite are hell-bent on Season Two of post-election mayhem, instead of addressing contentious issues around the 2017 general election. Horrendous crimes were committed in ‘sovereign’ Kenya in the dying days of December 2007. The debauchery intensified in January, falling in scale and scope through to February 28, 2008. That was the day a ceasefire was declared, thanks to foreign intervention in a country that often dangles ‘territorial sovereignty’ to spite the West. There were murders, rapes, forced circumcision, and arson, among other heinous offences against good order. After 60 days of power-instigated violence, about 1,200, lay dead. About 700 people were dispossessed. Thousands were injured. Hundreds of thousands of businesses were destroyed and premises were vandalised. Many struggling citizens were robbed of livelihoods. The power elite had forced war on a country that until then was supposed to be an “island of peace in a turbulent sea”. Mwai Kibaki entered the annals of history as the president who forced the country into a war that should have been avoided. The scars of the mayhem are still raw. Many families are still grieving. Widows, widowers, and orphans from the post-election violence give testimonies of political crimes that should have been avoided. There are people who carry permanent scars from this season of madness. Benard Orinda Ndege lost 11 members of his family in Naivasha during revenge attacks that ran through January 2008. The man is struggling to reconstruct his life as a fisherman on Lake Victoria. Meanwhile, the economy has dumped billions of shillings in trying to clean up the mess of Kibaki’s misrule. It was era that rekindled ethnic hostilities instead of nurturing the unity that saw Kibaki succeed Daniel Moi after failed attempts in the 1992 and 1997 presidential elections. Kenyans know the victims of these crimes, but the second-tier perpetrators are yet to be nailed, charged, convicted or acquitted. The Director of Public Prosecutions is hogging many of these files. Serious crimes remain unpunished in a ‘sovereign’ country that boasts functional intelligence, reportedly competent investigating and prosecution agencies, and a reforming judiciary. This is a sad commentary on national commitment to justice and the rule of law. The ICC failed to deliver justice due to bungled investigations, and interferences with witnesses. The State has also betrayed the citizenry by failing to deliver justice to victims of political insanity.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2016-04-20-were-on-a-new-path-to-hate/
15,True,True,JAMES KABUGI,04 November 2016 - 03:00,,The Church has betrayed Kenya,,"Martin Luther King Jr, the celebrated American civil rights icon, once said, “There comes a time when silence is betrayal.” The Church has been eerily silent at a time when extrajudicial killings have been on the rise, insecurity rife and recently, at news of audit queries of the use of the Sh5.2 billion allocated to the ministry of Health. Not long ago, there was a suggestion by the Attorney General that the churches should be taxed and suddenly, there was thunderous uproar from Christian organisations such as the National Council of Churches in Kenya and the Kenya Christian Church Forum, and all manner of scriptures were invoked until that suggestion was shelved. In 2010 during the plebiscite campaigns, the Church led the No campaign to reject the proposed Constitution. Their argument was that if the draft passed, it would legalise gay marriages, criminalise evangelism, entrench Sharia Law — because Kadhi Courts were retained — and allow abortion on demand. Many night vigils, keshas, were held countrywide and congregants were warned of “disobeying God’s directive” if they voted for the Constitution and how divine wrath would befall them. With corruption rampant in the country, some quotas have labelled the Jubilee government the most corrupt administration in the history of our country. Nepotism in the government is rife, tribalism has been pervasive in public service appointments and still, the Church is mute when it comes to condemning these forms of maladministration. A conscious Church is what dictates the moral trajectory of society. For instance, King Jr in the 1960s led the civil rights movement with a conviction from his Christian faith that all men were made equal before God. It is the black Church that withstood the persecution of the Jim Crow laws and eventually influenced the executive to repeal racist laws that were prejudicial to African Americans. They spoke up and the government listened and to this day, King Jr’s name is reminiscent of a figure of moral rectitude because he spoke up even when he was afraid. His conscience prevented him from remaining quiet in times of injustice. Churches in Kenya have been compromised by a good number of the religious leaders who unashamedly hob nob with politicians synonymous with unethical values that any society should abhor. They should instead be conduits of moral rectitude and good conscience where their authority is derived from an interaction with God and not politicians whose source of wealth is inexplicable or suspected to be from corrupt dealings. Just like King Jr once quipped, “There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.” In our time, even when the sick and critically ill are stolen from, the Church should at least speak up or forever lose its credibility and relevance in the court of public opinion. Besides it is written in Proverbs 31:8-9, “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.” It is now or never for the Kenyan Church.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2016-11-04-the-church-has-betrayed-kenya/
16,True,True,By Timothy Bosire,19 April 2017 - 01:00,,UhuRuto presides over our funeral,,"UhuRuto have no moral authority to campaign for reelection. They cannot run a dysfunctional government for four years, preside over devastating tribalism and crippling looting of public coffers and still want a further mandate. Another term to do what? Preside over the funeral of Kenya? What happened to Jubilee’s ambitious election pledges of 2013? Were the Jubilee manifesto and the promise of a perfect digital government a deliberate political fraud? Are Cabinet and Principal Secretaries to blame for the government’s massive failures? How, when they have President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto supervising them 24-7? Are the two in charge or is there a destructive disconnect somewhere that these officials are exploiting? This could be evidence of incurable leadership and management deficiencies afflicting the Jubilee high command? Why would PSs and CSs derail their bosses’ goals? Have they abandoned service delivery to pursue personal gain? And why would they abandon their legitimate mandates and still be allowed to occupy office? Recently, PSs were reshuffled. State House said it was to improve “teamwork in government”. But it was a mere face-saving knee-jerk reaction following revelations of PSs’ insubordination, crippling state departments. The latest was the ugly stand-off between PS Patrick Nduati and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa over tendering for construction of Thwake Dam in Ukambani. The PS had defied the CS, AG Githu Muigai, the main bilateral donor — the African Development Bank — and a parliamentary committee, and he had arrogantly awarded the tender to a higher bidder who had not been the best vetted. Many believed he had been compromised. Otherwise, why the determination to risk abortion of a major public project that could help Jubilee brag and lure voters for reelection? Logic demands summary dismissal of top officials who are openly insubordinate, corrupt or unpatriotic. Nduati and Nicholas Muraguri deserved to be sacked. Failure to do so could be interpreted to mean their misbehavior was sanctioned from above or they are sacred cows or, God forbid, the presidency is clueless about their transgressions. Kenyans saw similar shenanigans at Afya House between Health CS Cleopa Mailu and Muraguri. During the inquest into the NYS scandal, then PS Peter Mang’iti lamented of being sabotaged by juniors who were getting contradictory briefs from then Devolution CS Anne Waiguru. Recently there were murmurs from Foreign Affairs about a fallout between CS Amina Mohamed and PS Monica Juma over senior appointments to Kenya’s foreign missions. It is worth noting that the ministries and departments that seem to be harmony are rife with scandals. Hence, Eurobond and fraudulent borrowing (National Treasury), extrajudicial killings and police helicopter acquisition scandals (Interior), overpriced US warplanes (Defence), the Rio Olympics frauds (Sports), failed primary school laptops programme (Education) and others. Provision of services has become messy since UhuRuto took office. The two have only managed to revive and mainstream mega corruption, negative ethnicity and abortion of the ICC cases. We can therefore conclude that the Jubilee high command is a burden to Kenyans. It is led by politicians who do not know that leadership is a responsibility to voter and country. If they objectively compare their scorecard against their 2013 manifesto, they would realise they have failed Kenyans — badly. Then they would spare Kenyans the routine PR they broadcast in Parliament and other public forums.

17,True,True,By Liza Kimbo,29 December 2017 - 08:00,,Gender violence is still a grim reality,,"The world commemorated the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence from November 25 to December 10 - Human Rights Day. This was an opportunity for Kenyans to reflect on the linkage between GBV and human rights violations. This year’s theme in Kenya was ‘Leave No One Behind: End Violence against Women and Girls’, reflecting the core principle of the transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Human rights instruments, including the 2010 Constitution under Article 28, recognise human rights as based on human dignity, which is recognised as an inherent right, respected and protected. Unfortunately, Kenya has displayed multiple human rights violations, particularly sexual gender-based violence. A 2014 report by the National Gender and Equality Commission on Gender-Based Violence notes that GBV is one of the most widespread and socially tolerated forms of human rights violations, cutting across nationality, race, class, ethnicity, and religion. The report further indicates that GBV is a major source of inequality in Kenya today, and has a profound social and economic impact on families, communities, and the entire nation, as well as serious ramifications on national security. An emerging crisis evidenced in the report is in the high statistics for incest and rape, including within matrimonial settings that leave women and girls vulnerable. Nearly five out of 10 women aged 15-49 have at some point experienced physical violence since age 15. It was noted that pregnancy related violence results in physical and emotional trauma, leading to possible miscarriage or unsafe termination of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. The Constitution upholds human rights and dignity, and this inherently provides for protection of women from sexual violence, and a safe abortion where pregnancy results from such trauma. The Magnitude Study on Incidences and Complication of Unsafe Abortion in Kenya 2013, conducted by the Ministry of Health, reported more than 465,000 unsafe abortions performed in 2012. The study called for further investigations into the contribution of sexual violence to unintended pregnancies. Despite the staggering figures, numerous instances have been reported where women have been denied termination of pregnancy services for pregnancies arising out of rape, incest and sexual violence. There is also the rising issue of women and girls being forced by the police to keep the pregnancy in cases of incest or rape to preserve the infant to be used to retrieve DNA for evidence while prosecuting the perpetrator. This is unacceptable. These statistics are a wake-up call for the government to safeguard the inalienable right of human dignity of women against sexual gender-based violence by reforming and aligning our laws to conform with international laws, standards and practice, especially on decriminalisation of abortion and provision of abortion services to victims of sexual violence. It should also allocate more resources towards education and creating awareness of sexual gender-based violence; provide adequate mechanisms for reporting and protecting victims; and streamline police procedures to ensure proper investigations are carried out in a way that dignifies the victim and successful prosecution of perpetrators.

18,True,False,By Kennedy Buhere,26 January 2018 - 02:00,,Education makes us our own masters,,"There shall, in the future, be no community with an illiterate family, nor a family with an illiterate person.—Fundamental Code of Education, 1872 [Japanese Government Document] Low secondary school enrolment at the Coast will hold back the aspirations of so many boys and girls and their families. It will also irreparably undermine prosperity and stability for the foreseeable future. Business and political leaders should agonise over this, even though education is the preserve of the national government. The quality and strength of the political, economic and social life and prospects of the counties will depend, in large measure, on a certain standard of intelligence of the masses. The nation and the counties cannot satisfy their goals and objectives without an educated populace. Conduct of government, administration, trade, industry and even governance require that the people have knowledge, skills, attitudes, habits of thinking and behaviour. It is schooling, it is basic education that has the capacity to nurture the literacy and numeracy skills necessary. People can achieve so much with these skills and achieve next to nothing without them. The ability to read, write and count are but foundations, the launching pad for acquiring what wider skills that people need to master their own lives. In principle and practice, secondary curriculum consolidates skills acquired at primary level and the development of positive attitudes, values, personality and interests. Further, secondary educational experience (in form three and four) strengthens knowledge, skills and values acquired at the lower secondary level. The curriculum focuses on the development of interests, personality, attitudes and values, with specialisation in some fields to cater to the needs of higher education and future careers. Secondary education improves children’s prospects. It helps them realise their innate potential and overcome the constrictions that a lifetime of minimal literacy provides. It will strengthen their influence on the increased political opportunities, thanks to devolution. They will make informed decisions as citizens during competitive electoral politics, as well as during public policymaking and implementation. In a nutshell, secondary education and hopefully post-secondary education training will make them their own masters. Child marriage, drug peddling and abuse stifle children’s potential. The shortlived sensual pleasure with tourists on the beaches is delusional. The investments the government is making in primary education is lost if children fail to take advantage of the opportunities for further schooling. The Constitution provides for free and compulsory basic education. Those who fail to enrol children in school risk arrest and imprisonment. The political consequences of children in any region not going to school are more devastating than the risk of arrest. “… Illiteracy can also muffle the political opportunities of the underdog, by reducing their ability to participate in political arena and to express their demands effectively. This can contribute directly to their insecurity, since the absence of voice in politics can entail a severe reduction of influence and the likelihood of just treatment of those who are kept on the wrong side of the gap,” Nobel Prize Economist Amartya Sen observed in a speech at the Commonwealth education conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2003. Japan has used education to modernise its economy and military ever since it instituted universal and centralised education to all classes nearly 150 years ago.

19,True,True,Lucia Laboso,10 July 2018 - 00:30,,Teenage pregnancy a ticking bomb,,"The Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, 2014 reveals that 23 per cent of adolescent girls aged 15–19 have an unmet family planning need. This means the girls would like to delay or stop childbearing but are unable to access the necessary information, supplies and services. World Population Day, which will be marked tomorrow, provides us with an opportunity to boldly speak about the elephant in the room — teenage pregnancy. Recent data from the District Health Information System showed 7,182 girls aged between 10-19 were pregnant in Nairobi county between January last year and March. At this age, your typical girl is usually in upper primary or secondary school. Imagine how many classrooms those girls would fill. In a public school with an average of 50 students per classroom, those are about 144 classes filled to capacity. That would further translate to six primary schools with three streams per class. Interestingly, these are only the numbers captured within the public health system. There still remains many unreported cases. A significant number of cases are handled by private providers. Our biggest fear is that many adolescent girls resort to seeking help from backstreet quacks and the result is unsafe abortions. The question is, are we doing anything to address this ticking time bomb? If so, is it enough? An unexpected pregnancy changes the trajectory of a girl’s life with long-lasting physical, socioeconomic and psychological ramifications. Studies show maternal mortality rates are twice as high in girls aged 15-19 as those among adult women. The girls’ bodies are not yet ready for pregnancy. Consequently, complications in pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death within this age group, according to UN data. Despite the commendable return-to-school policy, which allows pregnant girls to stay in or go back to school after delivery, more must be done to stem the flow of teenage girls into the family way. Living in denial and burying our heads in the sand will not cut it. Kenya has no shortage of policies and commitments to address reproductive health and family planning needs. The Constitution undertakes to promote every person’s right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to healthcare, including reproductive care. The National Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health Policy 2015 intends to enhance the sexual reproductive health status of adolescents and contribute towards realisation of their full potential in national development. It intends to, among others, enhance equitable access to high quality, efficient and effective adolescent friendly ASRH information and services. Kenya is also a signatory to diverse regional and international instruments and commitments on adolescents, girls and women and reproductive health. These include the Maputo Protocol, Family Planning 2020 (FP2020 ) and the Sustainable Development Goals. Under FP2020 pledges last year, the country committed to expand youth-friendly services with a focus on adolescent girls, with a view to increase contraceptive prevalence rate among adolescents from 40 to 50 per cent and reduce teen pregnancy from 18 to 12 per cent by 2020. Despite this robust policy and legal framework, the reality — as far as implementation is concerned — is much less encouraging. The government has to the talk by ensuring adolescent girls have access to quality family planning products and services. Research shows when this happens, girls are able to keep healthy, stay longer in school and contribute to economic development. In this regard, investing a dollar in family planning makes an equivalent of $4 in socioeconomic returns. It is not only a right for women and girls but also a smart thing to do. As we mark World Population Day, it is important to make sure no girl is left behind due to teenage pregnancy. By providing age appropriate comprehensive sexuality education, youth-friendly services, accessible and quality reproductive health services, we can ensure girls plan their lives and make informed decisions on their future. Kenya cannot achieve Vision 2030 nor reap from the demographic dividend if it ignores them. Investing in family planning now will have impacts long into the future.

20,True,True,Felgonah Oyuga,22 November 2018 - 00:15,,FELGONAH OYUGA: Give us alternative to abortion,,"The Social Ethics teacher had my attention. I was in Form Two in an all-girls Catholic school (read sheltered). She said abortion was wrong, illegal and a sin under whatever circumstance. Even if the mother’s life was in danger. The mother had lived over 20 years (ideally). Why not sacrifice her life for her unborn baby? That evening I shared with my mother. She was a staunch Christian so I assumed that she would be happy I was siding with my Social Ethics teacher. You should have seen me, repeating verbatim what the teacher had said. My mother calmly asked me how many children I had birthed to think it would be an easy decision to leave my other children. Ok, that hit me. When I thought about it, my teacher then was not a mother either. So there could be another angle to this. But as an ignorant teenager, I still preferred the romance of a mother dying to give the foetus life. Not thinking that she was also someone’s child. Someone said to me, “If women do not want babies, they should not conceive, then get abortions!” He even added that women are ‘production managers’. While I know it has been said since days of old that women ‘trap’ men by getting pregnant, I still have mixed feelings about this because a grown man, who does not have to be educated even, should know he can father a child every time he climbs on a woman. So if he does not want to be a daddy, he should take precautions. Back to my point though, as women, we do not always have the luxury of deciding when we conceive. Society, religion and men most often decide. The church will tell you not to use contraception, that your body belongs to your husband. Fearing hell, you let go of control of your body. Society expects you to give birth. You reach a certain age, we expect fat babies from you. Never mind that throughout your adolescent years you were never to mix with the opposite sex. We just want you to get a man and start producing our namesakes. Men, not always our husbands, but even them, also decide sometimes through violence. Rape. You rarely hear men shouting against rape as passionately as they shout against abortion. Listen, women are not on this earth to bear pain upon pain. If only it was as simple as not conceiving, somehow the body would know this was rape and turn down the sperm. As simple as believing because another human told you that some being who has never had to carry a baby would not be too pleased with you. As simple as ‘stop having sex’( with ourselves though?). As simple as thinking I have the capacity to lay down my life at the expense of my living children. We ask too much of women. Going to war in the name of peace is not fun. Soldiers die, civilians too. Sometimes we must fight to preserve our lives. How is God able to forgive this? Listen, this life is not a rehearsal. We cannot have a group of people deciding for the rest of us. If you really feel that the option of abortion is wrong, come up to my level and reason with me. It is not enough to threaten me with hell and dreams of crying babies. I may already be living in hell. Tell me, what are you going to do about rape? How are you going to protect me? What will you do for me and this foetus that you care so much for when I do give birth, and I am a single mother and I cannot feed the baby? Will you protect me against society’s harsh criticism? Will you help me go on with my education? Will you counsel me? Will you take the baby if I do not want it? Abortion is a symptom of something. Until that thing is dealt with, allow me the right to preserve myself or I will take that right by force.

21,True,True,Abdullah Ibn Al-Qassim,03 December 2018 - 00:15,,ABDULLAH IBN AL-QASSIM: Muslims should marry Muslims,,"Recently TV journalist Ben Kitili provoked a backlash when he married Amina Mude. Theirs was a union between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim. It’s awkward to discuss this subject in the context of Ben’s marriage alone. To be objective, the debate is about Islam and interfaith marriages. Marriage choice is a human right that is valued in Islam. However, it is one that has been jealously guarded for centuries. This is because the choices one makes eventually affect the family and society. For this reason, most often society gets involved when such choices are made. Matrimony is the epicentre of the family unit, through which morals are grounded. Muslims, unlike Christians, are a closed society. Closed societies always fear losing something precious and would go to great lengths to protect it. Due to conflicts in majority of their countries, many Muslims have been forced to flee in search of peace and stability elsewhere, in the process losing their identity, values and standards—honesty, chastity, reliability and all things decent. Muslim women were admired for their moral high ground; the community valued chastity. What was inside the hijab was golden. Virginity in both genders was valued. Some of us were lucky to marry our wives at 24 when they were still virgins. This meant a lot, not only to us, but to the family, community and our offspring. Chastity inevitably protected society from STDs, unwanted pregnancies and babies, street urchins, abortions, come we stay marriages and single motherhood. Being chaste until marriage protects the union and minimises divorce cases. When a couple abstains from sex before marriage their union tends to last, for they have not tasted the sexual pleasure of others. It appears some closed societies have lowered their standards hence the easy penetration by other traditions. When a Muslim boy or girl no longer cherishes chastity, they cannot complain when a Christian picks up their diamonds. They have cheapened their treasure. Marriage between a Muslim and non-Muslim is prohibited in Islam, and for good reason. Islam means voluntary ‘Submission’ or ‘Surrender’ to the Will of God. It derives from the root word ‘salam’, meaning peace. Islam is a monotheistic faith. We believe that there is only one God (Allah) and that Muhammad and other prophets are his messengers. Marriage is a religious duty and consequently a moral safeguard and social necessity. There is no come-we-stay in Islam. It is a social necessity because through marriage, families are established, and in Islam, a family is an essential unit. As a father, I wouldn’t like my children to be in the company of those who don’t guard their morals. Islam wants to protect its values, culture and morality, and since marriage is the cornerstone of the family unit, we have to guard it. The general rule of Islam, dictated by God Himself, is that Muslims should marry Muslims. A Muslim woman is better suited to a Muslim man than a Christian, Hindu or Jew, regardless of their merits. Marriage is not just about fulfilling sexual desires but is an institution. It aims to establish a home on the bases of tranquility, faith and Islamic morals. Thus, the whole family must apply Allah’s path and convey His message (Koran 2:221 ). A Muslim woman will get the shorter end of the stick if she marries a non-Muslim. As husbands are generally the head of household, it’s not far-fetched to think a non-Muslim husband may prevent his Muslim wife from performing rituals that may seem like a nuisance to him, for example, fasting or even refraining from marital relations during the fast. To protect the sanctity of faith and marriage, Islam prohibits Muslims from actions that may restrict their worship of Allah. I wonder why Muslims are an easy target for criticism. The Hindus, who are also a closed community, don’t get criticised much, yet over the centuries only a few married non-Hindus. But then again, it’s the Muslims who are to blame for letting in too much. I don’t care how or what the society thinks of me, but at all costs I must enviously watch over my treasure. For a Muslim, the treasure is our purity and Islam, these are values that we hold dear and must not apologise for standing up for them.

22,True,True,AGUMBA NDALOH,01 January 2019 - 00:30,,AGUMBA NDALOH: Sex education will save teens,,"Many studies done in this country and elsewhere show teens engage in sexual activity from as early as age 11. The truth is that as a society, we cannot wish away the challenge of teen sexual activity and its attendant ramifications. We need to ask ourselves why our teenagers are becoming parents at such an early age. Do we have a remedy, and is it informed by research? Education officers, parents and teachers have been blamed for early pregnancies. But are they solely to blame? As a society don’t we have a role to address what in all shades is a societal problem? The causes of teen pregnancies are many and varied: Poverty, peer pressure, lack of knowledge on sexuality, rape and defilement, social practices that encourage teens being on their own, broken families, drug and substance abuse, outdated cultural practices, lack of parental education, ill-educated teachers to infuse sex education in the curriculum, access to un-vetted digital resources and a permissive society. Have we thought of the hidden consequences: The traumatic stress, the economic costs, physiological damage, school dropout, stigma, STIs and a host of other negatives that all await the teen mother? Many countries have gone through this problem and most have faced it head on. Two poles have emerged on how to solve the problem. Conservatives have called for abstinence while the progressives have advocated introduction of comprehensive sexuality and reproductive health education in the curriculum which should be age appropriate, evidence-based and free of scarring the intended audience. To the progressives, the curriculum should take a win-win approach where the learners are taught on abstinence and sex education. Unfortunately, in many countries (even ours) led by religionists and some conservatives, sex education has been condemned as being above the age of learners both mentally and emotionally. That it is a ticket to plunge the young generation into moral decadence. The liberals see sex education as a step towards empowering the youth to make informed decisions about their sexuality. Human beings are often guided by selfish interest. Many are the times we take lightly our neighbours' pain. The high moral rectitude of those calling for abstinence has been proved to be built on quick sand. Is it fair to leave the poor to worsen their lot by being subjected to further suffering and even at times forcing victims to procure abortions in backstreet clinics where loss of life looms large? The main solution is to introduce comprehensive sexuality education in our curriculum across the learning levels. We can do this as a stand-alone subject or through integration and infusion. Unfortunately for Kenya, religious organisations have been on the forefront in condemning any such attempts. This is not peculiar to Kenya. In the developed world, attempts by such bodies were ignored by the Executive with the support of the Judiciary. The two arms, coupled with an informed citizenry, realised the magnitude of the problem. What we should ensure is that the content is age appropriate and does not encourage any form of sexual orientation that goes against our traditions. Many countries which have taken this approach have greatly reduced the menace of early sexual activity among its teenagers and its attendant consequences. At least in both the 8-4-4 and the competency based curricula a modicum of sex education is addressed. Unfortunately both shy away from addressing the issue robustly due to the backlash it will generate. Kenyans are used to the pharisaic approach to life—drink wine but preach against it. What we need is to go the whole hog and introduce comprehensive sexuality and reproductive health education from the early years to tertiary institutions. Of course the issue of sex education should not only be a preserve of teachers. This should take a multi-stakeholder approach. We should also encourage self and peer education among the adolescents. Efforts by the Ministry of Education to beef up guidance and counselling in schools are encouraging. We should also introduce stiff penalties for adults who prey on adolescents.

23,True,True,By HUSSEIN KHALID,22 February 2019 - 00:30,,HUSSEIN KHALID: Carol’s death was not in vain,,"On February 20 Haki Africa and the world marked the UN World Day of Social Justice. The day is dedicated to recognising that social justice is an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations. In many countries, celebrations were held to promote and protect social justice and urge governments as well as citizens to play their rightful role in inculcating a culture of equality, ending poverty, exclusion and unemployment. The day was mostly dedicated to promoting fundamental rights and freedoms of the poor and marginalised. This year’s theme was ‘If you want peace and development, work for social justice.’ Ironically, the day was celebrated as the country was also preparing for the burial of Kenya’s social justice campaigner Caroline Mwatha. CarolMtetezi, as she is now known, was a founding member and senior officer of the Dandora Community Social Justice Centre. She met her untimely death in what so far remains unclear circumstances. CarolMtetezi was documenting extrajudicial killings of youth in and around Dandora when she disappeared early this month and was later found dead at City Mortuary. Her disappearance and subsequent death caused an uproar, and activists took to the streets and clashed with the police. CarolMtetezi will be buried this weekend. In Nairobi, there are at least 11 different social justice centres. Besides the one in Dandora, others are in Mathare, Kibera, Mukuru, Kayole, Huruma, Kiambio and Korogocho. These centres are working at the grassroots to promote social justice and human rights. They work in dangerous circumstances and the lives of their workers remain always at risk. There are many CarolMtetezis out there who continue to soldier on for justice in risky areas. Kenyans need to know there are such people who sacrifice their safety and security every day to promote and protect social justice, human rights and rule of law. With security provision being directly a constitutional human rights responsibility of the state, whenever a violation occurs, the police cannot be exonerated as they are the primary security providers. Even though citizens have a duty to promote security, it is the police who are paid using taxpayers’ money to enforce security. Police must guarantee the security of all social justice actors and human rights defenders. It is the responsibility of the state to determine whether CarolMtetezi met her death in the process of procuring an abortion or through a police officer who murdered her but wanted to make it look like it was a botched abortion. It is also the responsibility of the state to bring the culprits to book. Social justice has always been sidelined as the rich and middle class consider this as not being a priority. Social justice is usually much-needed by the poor, vulnerable and weak in society. Although a good percentage of our population live in abject poverty, state policies have often ignored this group and instead worked to satisfy mostly the rich and middle class. If we are to move forward as a nation, we must change our policies to incorporate social justice. Our policies should replace extrajudicial killings with jobs for youth and human rights violations with food on the table for every home in the slums. During this week as we mark the World Day of Social Justice, Haki Africa is demanding the formal recognition of social justice centres and their work. Many grassroots campaigners have met their death in the quest for social justice. Society is not judged by how it treats its rich, powerful and the politically correct, but by how it treats its poor, vulnerable and weak. Equality can best be realised through social justice. We must safeguard more the rights and freedoms of the poor, vulnerable and marginalised by ensuring those fighting for their rights are equally protected. We must demand the government not only supporta human rights but also social justice activism. The time for justice is now. Human rights campaigners must not and will not relent in the quest for social justice.

24,True,True,Joanne Kobuthi-Kuria,05 April 2019 - 00:00,SEXUAL VIOLENCE,Muting R Kelly: Finally victims get attention,"• Just like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, R Kelly wielded immense power • He hid behind his victims' vulnerability and a system that was set up to disbelieve women","It is alleged that R Kelly was in a sexual relationship with Aaliyah’s mother as he was seeing the underage A ge ain’t nothing but a number musician. That he induced several under-age girls into indecent sexual relationships, impregnated some and forced them to procure abortions. The sexual exploitation included making child pornography, oral sex and urination among others. It doesn’t get any murkier than this. All these allegations are at best damning and at worst outright disgusting. Multiple charges, a penchant for underage girls and court settlements, R Kelly escaped rather unscathed. His illustrious music career often overshadowed these two-decade long allegations. With titles such as ‘King of Pop-Soul and King of RnB’, everything he touched turned into platinum. Hit songs such as I believe I can fly , Step in the name of love , Michael Jackson's You are not alone , Aaliyah’s chart-topping Back and Forth and Age ain’t nothing but a number , firmly cemented him in the upper echelons of musical greats—as super-producer, songwriter and musician—this generation has seen. The gall of R Kelly led him to release a song called I Admit , in which he confessed to being sexually unfaithful and his own experience of abuse but denied accusations of paedophilia and operating a sex cult. ""Only God can mute me,"" he sings defiantly. ""Am I supposed to go to jail or lose my career because of your opinion?"" Well, the self-acclaimed Pied Piper of RnB sang too soon. Shortly after the allegations surfaced, the tide shifted. Droves of artists distanced themselves from him. Some issued public apologies for working with Kelly. Others instructed streaming platforms to withdraw their collaborated songs. Others decided not to perform songs Kelly wrote for them or collaborated with him on. Whilst others like John Legend outrightly called Kelly out! Music label Sony Music and its subsidiary label RCA Records parted ways with Kelly, striking him out of their artist roster. According to media reports, his publicist, lawyer and long-term assistant all severed ties with him. And the viral hashtag #MuteRKelly among other things galvanised global conversations on sexual assault and abuse. The heart-wrenching six-hour long documentary Surviving R-Kelly retells real-life experiences of abuse and victim resignation. I can only imagine the intangible loss victims of physical and sexual abuse experience. One that they can’t dust off or leave in the hallway. One that dismantles worth and leaves them in a pool of torment and shame. Psychologists assert that sexual assault and rape are obviously sexual offences but long before the physical act, these offences are a display of power and an exertion of dominance. Just like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, R Kelly wielded immense power: he hid behind his victims' vulnerability and a system that was set up to disbelieve women when they spoke. The allegations against these powerful men unmasked vile perpetrators who rode the wave of power, success and a system that emboldened, buffered and enabled this stomach-churning behaviour. I hope that speaking up and speaking out against Kelly will offer the victims much-needed catharsis and an empathetic society that speaks up and speaks out against sexual violence in all its shapes, forms and sizes. The court of public opinion and the online world are baying for his blood. You see folks, the pendulum of justice may swing either way—an acquittal or a conviction. But what stands as the truth is that finally a woman can be heard and believed. Alleged predators like Robert Sylvester Kelly no longer have a grip on us!

25,True,True,[],06 May 2019 - 04:00,RIGHT-WING POPULISM,EU could go the Soviet way,"• There is a general rise in nationalism, which poses a real threat to the future of the EU. • Populists have been gaining strength for two decades now, and if this goes on for another five years, the EU could just vanish.","For the second time in a month, a member country of the European Union has ‘not’ voted a populist into power. Could it be that the populist wave has broken? It would be a good time for that to happen because elections to the EU’s Parliament are scheduled next month. The hard-right populist parties, who have already proliferated in the 28-member countries, were hoping to sweep into a dominant position in the EU Parliament as well next month, but maybe the story will be more nuanced. The Spanish election saw the traditional socialist party (PSOE) increase its vote by a quarter under the leadership of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. “The future has won and the past has lost,” said Sánchez, who has raised the minimum wage, appointed a female-dominated Cabinet and promised to bring in laws defining rape as sex without clear consent during his brief time in power. That wasn’t the headline the next day, of course. Good news is no news. So, the media played up the fact that a particularly nasty party of Right-wing populists called Vox has made it to the Spanish Parliament for the first time. Vox is anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and promises to “make Spain great again”. It wants to repeal laws against gender violence and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. But it actually only got 10 per cent of the votes and most of those it stole from the Popular Party, the traditional home for nationalist and ultra conservative voters. Sánchez will still have a hard time putting a coalition government together — he’s probably going to have to make some deal with the Catalan separatists, which will alienate many other Spaniards — but this is not exactly populism triumphant. It wasn’t a populist triumph in Slovakia last month either. The neo-fascist candidate, Marian Kotleba, didn’t even make it into the run-off presidential vote. In the second round, Zuzana Caputova, a neophyte in politics, beat the candidate of Robert Fico’s ruling Smer-SD Party, which plays by Right-wing populist rules and has close links with Viktor Orban’s elective dictatorship in Hungary. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office in Slovakia, so Fico is still really running the government (although he had to step down as Prime Minister last year after an investigative journalist looking into links between Slovak politicians and organised crime was shot dead by hired killers). It’s not all roses yet in Slovakia, but spring is in the air. So what does this tell us about the populist wave in Europe in general and about the EU parliamentary elections next month in particular? Not as much as you’d like because ‘Europe’ is a very complicated place. What we can say is that there is a general rise in nationalism, from Brexit-supporting Britain to a huge surge of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant feeling in Eastern European countries (which have almost no Muslims, or indeed immigrants of any sort). We can also say (although most people won’t admit it) that nationalism on this scale does pose a real threat to the future of the EU. The EU was the great political success story of the latter half of the 20th century. What was once the most war-torn part of the globe, the source of both the world wars, has become the most peaceful, cooperative and democratic region on the planet. It also looks after its citizens, on average, better than almost anywhere else. Why would they (or at least a lot of them) now be in rebellion against all that? Economic growth has been slower in the past few decades but they are not poor. The gap between the rich and the rest has been widening but not nearly as much as it has in the US or China or Russia. Why risk throwing it all away? The EU has lost its unifying external threat. It was the menace of an allegedly expansionist Soviet Union that drove the Western European founders of EU to bury all their old quarrels and come together but the Soviet Union is long gone and Putin’s Russia is not really a plausible replacement. Another irritant is the growing pressure of immigration: Refugees from wars in the Middle East and from both tyranny and climate change in Africa. The ‘threat’ that immigration poses is greatly exaggerated but the 28 different governments of the EU have not come up with a coherent and effective policy to deal with it while the populists exploit it with great success. The Right-wing populist group of parties in the European Parliament currently holds 37 seats in the 751-member Parliament but the latest opinion polls predict that it will rise to 61 seats in next month’s election. If the UK is still in the EU at that time, which seems likely, the total could rise to a hundred but that’s still hardly a landslide. The concern is not for the immediate future but for the trend line. The populists have been gaining strength for two decades now, and if this goes on for another five years, the EU could just vanish, the way the old Soviet Union did in 1991. So from that point of view, at least, the news from Spain and Slovakia is good news.",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2019-05-06-eu-could-go-the-soviet-way/

We cannot continue burying our heads in the sand while statistics show that at least seven women are dying every day in Kenya from unsafe abortions. The government must facilitate abortion services for women whose pregnancies pose a danger to their lives and health as stipulated in the Constitution. Targeting Marie Stopes clinics will lead to the mushrooming on unsafe abortion clinics that pose an even greater danger to Kenyan women. In addition, Marie Stopes clinics offer a range of reproductive health services for both men and women. It would, therefore, be foolhardy to terminate their licences under the guise of offering abortions as this denies many other Kenyans health services. As the Constitution states, every Kenyan has a right to the highest standards of health and it is the role of the government to ensure that this is made possible.

Now she's been murdered. You start an investigation by looking for a motive. The police had a motive to kill Mwatha because she was documenting their crimes. So the police is the primary suspect in the public eye . The police have told human rights groups that they think Mwatha died as a result of a botched abortion. They say they know the doctor. If so, why have they not arrested the doctor? Normally a woman takes time to die after a botched abortion. Why was this so sudden? Why have the police not yet gone to the alleged clinic? The police had refused to brief the family because they would leak details of the investigation to the media. Is this just an excuse for a cover-up?

We should also ponder decriminalising the procedure in the first trimester, the practice in many Western countries. Opinion in Kenya is deeply divided. No one on either side of the debate likes the idea of abortion. Some are absolutely opposed, even in the case of a 9-year-old girl raped, made pregnant by her father and kicked out of her home. They say it's murder, even at the moment of conception, though the medical definition of pregnancy is embedding of a fertilised egg in the wall of the uterus. They further say that legalising abortion would promote promiscuity. Kenyan law makes abortion illegal in virtually all circumstances, unless a certified health professional says the life or health of the mother is in danger. In 2013 the Health ministry withdrew guidelines on performing safe abortions, a simple procedure early on, and on handling botched abortions. It has banned health workers from training on abortion.

Their Kenya 2030 report gave findings from focus groups with young men. One key finding is that only three percent of field health workers discuss contraception with 15 to 19 year-olds. As a result, they learn about contraception too late resulting in unwanted pregnancies and teenage abortions. There are 465,000 abortions a year in Kenya. Effective family planning education could massively reduce this. Women should be given proper access to family planning services but, just as important, men need to act responsibly. Men should ask women if they are taking precautions and, if they are not, they should use a condom or practice withdrawal. Vasectomies are safe and nowadays reversible. That is an effective long-term solution available to men. Kenya's population is predicted to exceed 90 million by 2050 and 160 million by 2100. This is not sustainable. The government needs to reactivate the powerful family planning programmes of the 1970s and increase health education in schools.

Sixty one per cent of its population is either children – between birth and 14 – or youth aged 15 to 24, according to a United Nations 2017 report. Large scale investments in education, health and improving employment interventions for these young people could bring tremendous benefit to the economy of this country. If these young people remain jobless and without education, they will be frustrated and turn to crime or violence. If we could turn this population of the youth into a skilled working population, we can achieve demographic dividend. According to the Lancet, $4.6 (Sh461 ) per person per year, investment in programmes to improve outcomes for adolescents and young people, could bring a tenfold economic unsupported boost. Despite such potential, very little investment is put in young people of this country due to the perceptions that young people are still young and face fewer health risks. But the truth is that young people are at risk. In Kenya, young people account for 52 per cent of new HIV infections. Unsafe abortion, unintended pregnancies, untreated diseases and infections, non-communicable diseases, child marriage, drug abuse, depression, mental health disorder, female genital mutilation and high unemployment rates are some of the threats young people face. There is a need for Kenya to invest more in sexual and reproductive health services and skills development for adolescents and young people of this country if we want them to compete in the global economy of the future.

36,True,True,Nelson Akoth,08 April 2019 - 00:00,TEEN PREGNANCIES,State should take the lead in ending teen pregnancies,•Adolescent pregnancy increases the risk of maternal mortality and morbidities,"A number of factors have been associated with adolescent pregnancies. While many adolescents may choose to get pregnant or impregnate, many pregnancies occur in the context of human rights violations such as child marriage, harmful traditional rites of passage, coerced sex or sexual abuse. Broader socioeconomic factors such as poverty, lack of education and limited economic opportunities among girls and boys may also contribute towards high adolescent pregnancy rates. Furthermore, lack of reproductive healthcare services for adolescents particularly lack of contraceptive education and affordable, available contraceptive commodities means contraceptive use among adolescents is generally low, exposing the sexually active generation to all forms of explicitly sexual content either from media or ill intent people within their surrounding. Adolescents face greater complications during pregnancy because they are not fully physiologically and biologically prepared due to gynaecological immaturity and incomplete pelvic growth. Adolescents may be disadvantaged in maintaining a healthy pregnancy due to poor health education, inadequate access to non-judgemental antenatal care and skilled birth attendance among other healthcare services, or the inability to afford costs of pregnancy and childbirth. Adolescent pregnancy, whether intended or unintended, increases the risk of maternal mortality and morbidities including complications of unsafe abortion, prolonged labour, delivery and the post-natal period, obstetric fistula among other effects. Averting this deep-rooted evil, as studies confirm Kenya's young population, multi-sectoral and consistent concerns over the young generation situations is key. As health systems tackle plans on educating adolescents on emergency-based life skills combining sexuality education, education systems should do much more to ensure the provision of sexuality education in the teachers training syllabuses and institutions. The Ministry of Interior and courts should strengthen law enforcement on predators.

Buying a limping and wobbling bank is like buying second-hand clothes. Otherwise, why would a financial guru sell a profitable and thriving bank? In the year ending December 2018, Spire Bank sank deeper into the red after reporting Sh2.2 billion loss. The bank’s assets also fell by Sh1.9 billion or 17 per cent to Sh9.2 billion. The rest, as they say, is history and for teachers themselves. Territorial disputes among counties should also not be downplayed in whatever adventures and misadventures they partake. I am afraid the same will repeat itself, if not worse, with any of the six regional economic blocs that want to acquire banks for whatever purposes. I have no doubt that already confirmed corrupt county officials will only acquire limping banks. Thriving and successful banks will not let go of their decades of investments. Counties’ leadership should not waste taxpayers' resources in acquiring “mitumba” banks. They should start their own new banks if they have sufficient resources to do so. Last but not least, I congratulate MCAs from the Lake Region Economic Bloc who have repeatedly shot down budgets with Sh200 million as their contribution to start a bank that has ab initio aborted.

However, the missing information is the prevalence of abortion at the county level. For example, Kisumu and Homa Bay are among the top 10 counties leading in deaths of women. There is, however, no specific information on deaths related to unsafe abortion. Do we have numbers of women who died while attempting to terminate a pregnancy? How do we arrive at the estimated 464,000 cases of unsafe abortion? Information on the prevalence of unsafe abortion at the county level will, therefore, guide planning of health interventions to reduce not only cases of unsafe abortion, but also the consequences that include maternal mortalities and morbidities. Specific data on where the cases of abortion occurred will, therefore, help in identifying the contributors or reasons to unsafe abortion. Is it because of pregnancy-related stigma? Maybe its families of the women pushing them to terminate ‘unwanted’ pregnancies. Families could be forcing young daughters to abort by instilling fear or suggesting that ‘getting a baby before marriage is a sin in this house’. Or they could be planning to marry off their daughters to older men who have promised the family a fortune. Is it lack of accessibility to services? Cultural beliefs that prohibit pregnancy before marriage? Or just the inability to raise enough funds for a proper process? Or perhaps it’s the laws in the Constitution that bar the young, scared women from using seeking proper channels. Either way, we are losing innocent girls to back-alley procedures for one of these reasons or others related to retrogressive cultural practices. Pinpointing the actual problem will be a step towards solving it.

Unfortunately, due to the society that we live in, the choice of motherhood for women and women’s right has been eroded by either the law, patriarchal manipulation, gender inequality, religious doctrines or culture. Women, especially those in poverty have little and sometimes no say in determining whether to have children or not. When they finally get the chance to exercise choice for abortion, they turn to unsafe and illegal methods putting their health and lives at risk. Half out of the 500,000 abortions performed in Kenya every year are unsafe. As a result, seven women die every day due to unsafe abortion. The fact that women were created with a womb can give birth does not imply that they have an obligation of being mothers. If a woman is not ready to be a mother, it is our duty to support her in all ways and providing her with the services and information she needs in order to avoid becoming a mother. All women should be free to choose what to do with their own bodies and life and this should be accepted and supported by everyone.

Last year, severe complications from unsafe abortion accounted for 54 per cent of the total health costs. Post-abortion care also consumes a significant amount of resources that would otherwise be spent on other areas of health including reproductive, maternal and child health. It takes an average of 12 hours to treat severe complications of unsafe abortion with an average cost of Sh4,900. Cost of treating unsafe abortion is on the rise at Sh433 million in 2012 and Sh533 million in 2016. These costs are double the budget required to increase contraceptive access to 100,000 women of reproductive age.

The world is struggling to define, develop and implement viable mitigation and adaptation interventions to climate change effects. The transport sector is one of the major contributors of a significant percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, resulting in increased atmospheric temperatures, hence, global warming. Carbon dioxide is generated from the combustion of fossil fuels. The invention and utilisation of electric cars for commercial and personal use came at a time when the world realised the need to address noise and air pollution, as well as adopt renewable energy over non-renewable sources. It is even getting better. Shared automated electric cars are in operation in most developed cities. Most European countries have embraced the practice for its benefits. Shared automated cars are arguably convenient, cheaper and easy to use within designated areas. With an application on one’s smartphone and a registered account, you can locate the cars; if the distance and place parked is convenient then you can reserve it. No need for a car key or a driver. You only need your up-to-date driving licence. The application will open and activate the car and allow you to drive to wherever you want within the designated radius. You are charged per minute of usage, which is relatively cheap. The good thing about these shared automated electric cars is they allow one the convenience of leaving the car at any given point they opt not to proceed with the journey. You are only charged for the time you spent. This is better compared to ordinary taxis where clients are charged a predetermined amount, even if they abort the trip along the way. The fact that these cars are silent reduces noise pollution common with fuel-powered cars; are electric hence use renewable energy, reducing the amount of fossil fuels burnt and ultimately reducing the amount of carbon particles escaping into the atmosphere. Renewable energy is clean; no exhaust fumes being generated therefore air pollution does not occur. In Rome, Italy, where there are so many cars and traffic is a mess with limited parking space, the introduction of shared automated electric vehicles seems to have picked up well. The cars are thought to be a solution to existing environmental and transportation challenges. The compact nature of the cars requires a smaller parking space. Speaking from experience, this model of transportation is convenient, inexpensive, environment-friendly and futuristic. Michele Governatori, an energy economics expert and a journalist on environment and energy in Italy, said, “Much space in towns is inefficiently used by parked cars and so limiting space for pedestrians and other activities. ""A huge amount of capital is also absorbed by cars which are individually owned and left parked most of the time. Car sharing allows people in cities to have private mobility when necessary without owning a car. It’s clearly efficient.” Just like Rome, Nairobi is one city that needs a feasible solution to ease vehicle congestion. Despite the reduction of the age of vehicles to be imported into the country and increased duty fee on new cars, the number of cars keeps going up each year. With our poor-conditioned and smaller roads, traffic gets worse. Nairobi needs shared automated electric cars for all the good reasons. I must acknowledge the presence of electric vehicles, including the recently introduced shared electric vehicles however fewer they are. Nonetheless, the future of Nairobi and other big cities around the world is in electric cars, better still shared electric cars. Environmentalist.

At the facilities, medical personnel will not attend to women who had attempted procuring abortion as they fear that in the event that the woman succumbs to illness, the health practitioners will be arrested. Survivors of attempted abortion especially those with severe complications experience neglect between the time of procuring an abortion and seeking treatment. In both public and private facilities, these women will be forced to lie on the dirty floor, be branded murderous, experience delays or even be denied treatment. Financial constraints may lead to the survivors of abortion being locked up in the health facilities due to inability to pay hospital bills. Their identification cards are forcefully taken by the health administration and are forced to do manual jobs within the facilities to pay for off their debt. Not forgetting that the women are just recovering from an abortion, being held up in the facilities and being compelled to work further worsens their health. Forceful acquisition of identification cards of people who cannot treatment is also a violation of the Constitution. To reduce deaths and diseases associated with unsafe abortion, it is necessary we address termination of pregnancy within the context of the Constitution that explains the situations in which it is permitted.

Many of these women are left infertile or with lifelong disabilities and haemorrhage. Girls and women in informal settlements are mostly affected, coupled with abortion-related stigma. Restrictive laws on termination of pregnancy result in women seeking services from unqualified medical personnel where the minimum cost is Sh1,500 not forgetting the limited chances of survival and complications. The landmark ruling on the reinstatement of guidelines on reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity was a huge eye-opener on how women and girls are denied the right to accessing quality and responsive sexual reproductive health information and services.

The ruling was also an affirmation that any survivor of rape or defilement has a right of accessing safe and legal abortion services. The World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

This day is celebrated globally every August 12. In regard to sexual and reproductive health, this theme is timely as young people need information on where to find the youth-friendly services and the services available. Article 53 (1b) of the Constitution states that education should be free and compulsory, whereas article 55 (a) states that the state will take measures, including affirmative action programme to ensure that the youth access relevant education and training. Among the challenges young people face is accessibility to information and limited implementation of return to school policy for young mothers. Many young people don’t have clear and appropriate information to protect themselves from unsafe abortions, HIV infections, early marriage and sexually transmitted infections, which are rampant among them. Education will reduce myths and misconceptions in the use of contraceptives and mitigate the impact of wrong information from other sources, including peers. Lack of information and limited school enrolment are to blame for increased cases of unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion, STIs, including HIV, and more so poverty. As we celebrate the theme of transforming education, the government of Kenya should prioritise accessibility to education by all, while integrating reproductive health education to safeguard the health of young people. The world should also prioritise the theme to ensure parents or guardians have the skills to communicate sexuality issues with teenagers or adolescents. Awareness on other health issues, especially cancer, which has become the talk of the town in Kenya, should also have space in education. Provision of free primary and secondary education will empower people in decisionmaking, including when to engage in sex and thereby lower cases of unintended pregnancies. Research shows women who are educated are likely to space births compared to women without education. Kenya must effectively budget and plan for resources for provision of free primary and secondary education in order address the problem of limited skills, unemployment and poverty as these factors have links to ill health and unintended pregnancies, school dropout and unsafe abortion. Provision of comprehensive sexual education will enable young people to make informed choices about their sexuality. Awareness campaigns, initiation of sexual education at an early age, equipping teachers with skills to provide comprehensive sexual education at an early age and eliminating myths and misconceptions among religious organisations through skill-building will transform education for young people.

This surpasses the 2020 target of 58 per cent. However, the youth who are sexually active are reported to contribute lesser to the achievement as compared to married adults. Only three in every 10 young women are using a modern contraception method. This leads to a high rate of unplanned pregnancies among young people that leads to abortion, most of which is procured in back-street alleys due to lack of funds or stigma associated with pregnancy at a young and unmarried age. Unsafe abortion accounts for 15 per cent of all maternal deaths in Kenya. As we celebrate World Contraception Day on September 26, more robust approaches to address the gaps are needed. The UN International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), which will be hosted in Kenya later this year, calls for expanded access to high-quality family planning services to meet individual needs. Therefore, a concerted effort needs to be put in place to expand equitable access to the underserved population of young people by designing innovative youth-friendly programmes to reach the youth. This could include helplines, peer outreach programmes and text messaging to make family planning information and services easily accessible. This will save lives by reducing the number of both unsafe abortions and maternal deaths among women of reproductive age.

This decline is attributed to delivery by a skilled birth attendant, elimination of delivery charges in public health facilities as well as access to information on family planning. We must have equity in resource allocation and service provision especially in the treatment of haemorrhage and cervical cancer. In addition, we must address other factors that contribute to the death of women including unsafe abortion, HIV and pregnancy-related complications Naya Kenya, Nairobi",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2019-10-16-state-can-do-more-to-keep-up-drop-in-maternal-mortality/
62,True,True,Daniel Otieno,25 October 2019 - 00:00,ADOPT THEM,WHO guidelines on abortion will reduce maternal deaths,"• After the conference held in Cairo in 1994, governments pledged their commitment to reducing the need for abortion through improved family planning services. • Most people are not aware of the guidelines provided in the Kenyan Constitution for when abortion is allowed.","In 1967, the World Health Organization highlighted unsafe abortion as a health issue affecting women. However, it wasn’t until 1987 when the safe motherhood conference was held in Nairobi that the world understood unsafe abortion as a public health concern. At the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994, governments again identified unsafe abortion as a public health concern and pledged their commitment to reducing the need for abortion through expanded and improved family planning services. This commitment also appreciated the fact that whereas abortion is against the law, it should be provided in a safe environment by qualified medical personnel to safeguard the health of the mother as a priority. Thirty two years after the Nairobi conference and 25 years after the Cairo forum, different countries are still grappling with the issues and impacts of unsafe abortion. WHO, in its 1995 managerial guidelines for improving the quality and availability of abortion care, states that national authorities are responsible for deciding whether and under what circumstances to medically terminate pregnancies. The Constitution of Kenya, for example, provides situations permitting termination of pregnancy. However, limited knowledge of this constitution results in abortion-related stigma, women resorting to unsafe methods of abortion and increased cases of abortion-related deaths. Prioritising the health of women is urgently needed to reduce maternal deaths. Implementation of the articles on abortion should go in hand with training of medical personnel, closing quack clinics and educating the communities on the dangers of abortion-related stigma.

63,True,True,Daniel Otieno,07 November 2019 - 00:00,MATERNAL MORBIDITY,Medics’ attitude and stigma still a barrier to safe abortion,• Health workers have not undergone training on the provision of safe abortion. • There is also limited research that highlights cases of abortion among learners.,"The Constitution of Kenya permits abortion if in the opinion of a trained health care provider, the life of the woman is in danger or if a written law permits it. A written law here being any legislation passed by Parliament that permits termination of a pregnancy. However, despite the Constitution being in place, many women still undergo unsafe abortion including going for backstreet methods and untrained midwives. The attitudes of health workers that are backed by religious values, the stigma associated with an unintended pregnancy, limited conversations between parents and adolescents, a lack of life skills education in schools and limited allocations to improving maternal health contribute to cases of unsafe abortion. Even though the Ministry of Health reinstated the national standard and guidelines for reducing maternal mortality and morbidity related to unsafe abortion, health workers have not undergone training on the provision of safe abortion. Comprehensive sexuality education does not target life skills that may prevent unintended pregnancy and, therefore, learners are at risk of procuring an abortion. There is also limited research that highlights cases of abortion among learners. Since data is not collected among providers in the backstreet clinics, the current figures on deaths related to unsafe abortion may be underestimated. The government has not shown much commitment to this as seen in the small number of doctors who have been trained on post-abortion care. There is also a need to come up with research on the prevalence of unsafe abortion in learning institutions, with the focus on primary and secondary schools. This data will help guide interventions to reduce maternal deaths.

64,True,True,Daniel Otieno,06 December 2019 - 00:00,HUMAN RIGHTS,Use 16 Days of Activism to raise awareness to GBV,"• Sexual and gender-based violence takes different forms including forced abortions, gang rape, rape used as a form of conflict, cyberbullying. • Several gaps exist in addressing sexual and gender violence among young girls and women in Kenya including delayed prosecution of court cases.","The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign that kicks off on November 25–the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women–and runs until December 10–Human Rights Day. In Kenya, sexual and gender-based violence takes different forms. These include forced abortions, rape, cyberbullying, spousal killings and forced sterilisation of persons with disabilities among others. In 2017, the International Planned Parenthood Federation Africa region offered over 1.3 million services relating to sexual and gender-based violence. In Kenya, 14 per cent of women and six per cent of men aged 15-49 have experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This includes adolescent girls who are just transitioning to early adulthood. Sexual violence comes with many repercussions on reproductive health. This includes loss of self-esteem and reduced productivity, infection with Sexually Transmitted Infections as well as unintended pregnancies. The trauma resulting from sexual violence that has been perpetrated by relatives, especially parents, creates an emotional impact for a long time. Children, especially adolescent girls, who were raped by their fathers or close relatives, take time to emotionally heal. In school, these children prefer being isolated and their concentration is also affected. Several gaps exist in addressing sexual and gender violence among young girls and women in Kenya. These include delayed prosecution of court cases, inadequate trained counsellors and health workers and failure by victims to open up if the sexual violence involved relatives. Bail for perpetrators also puts victims through trauma. Naya Kenya, Nairobi",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2019-12-06-use-16-days-of-activism-to-raise-awareness-to-gbv/
65,True,True,Daniel Otieno,10 December 2019 - 22:00,DISCRIMINATION OF GENDERS,CEDAW proposals not valid with gaps in Kenyan policies,• Any policy that wants to end discrimination against women must ensure they are getting all the health services they need. • Law also leaves the court with the discretion of deciding what the woman deserved during divorce proceedings.,"The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. CEDAW aims at ensuring that traditional gender roles and stereotypes do not work against the interest of girls as the country still grapples with challenges of ending female genital mutilation, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence. Women’s right to health includes their sexual and reproductive health. Therefore, any policy that wants to end discrimination against women must ensure they are getting all the health services they need. If put into practice, CEDAW can play an important role in ending discrimination against women. Key gaps in CEDAW implementation in Kenya are seen in the Marriage Act, Matrimonial Property Act and Land Rights Act. Ratifying CEDAW implies the convention should be part of the Constitution. However, in Kenya, sections of the three Acts contravene the CEDAW recommendations. For instance, the Marriage Act negates the gain of equality in marriage and calls on spouses to show contribution. The law also leaves the court with the discretion of deciding what the woman deserved. There are numerous cases of FGM, deaths related to unsafe abortion and mortality rates associated with a lack of skilled birth attendants. During doctors’ strikes, many deaths occur during delivery. For CEDAW recommendations to be effective in Kenya, there is a need to address the existing gaps. There is also a need to strengthen laws and policies around property ownership rights to ensure that in cases of separation, women have a share of property and child upkeep becomes a shared responsibility.

66,True,True,Daniel Otieno,14 January 2020 - 00:00,SEXUAL HEALTH,Research on causes of unsafe abortion will reduce related deaths,• Governments have not invested in systematic reviews of the main contributors that make young women procure unsafe abortion. • Unsafe abortion not only results in pregnancy and health complications but also in deaths that can be prevented,"Several factors are responsible for the rising cases of unsafe abortion in sub-Saharan Africa. First and foremost is that governments have not invested in systematic reviews of the main contributors that make young women procure unsafe abortion. In addition, peer pressure, abandonment by a spouse, limited knowledge on the situations abortion is permitted, inaccessibility to family planning methods and unintended pregnancy contribute to rising cases of unsafe abortion. It is no doubt that sexual activity comes at an early age. At the age of nine, boys and girls are already engaging in sex. At this age, boys and girls can access the internet through mobile phones and thus, most information on sex is within their reach. As a result of peer pressure and inappropriate information from the internet, unintended pregnancies may easily result in procuring unsafe abortion. Parents get to know the procured abortion at the start of health complications, which include hemorrhage, and when adolescents decide to stay away from home. In other situations, pregnancy may be unexpected or the parties involved are not ready to take responsibility. This scenario leads to abandonment or separation. Coupled with the financial difficulties, women who are victims of family separation and unintended pregnancy resort to procuring an abortion in an unsafe environment. A notable factor is that unsafe abortion not only results in pregnancy and health complications but also in deaths that can be prevented. We must invest more in educating communities on the risk involved with unsafe abortion. The Constitution of Kenya is already clear on the situations abortion is permitted. We must also ensure uninterrupted access to safe planning methods by women of reproductive age. provision of appropriate information on sexuality will also reduce the prevalence of unsafe abortion. Let us engage the media in offering education related to prevention of unintended pregnancy while implementing comprehensive sexuality education in schools. Finally, as trends on abortion emerge, there is need for more research on the main contributors of unsafe abortion Network for Adolescents and youth of Africa, Nairobi",https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2020-01-14-research-on-causes-of-unsafe-abortion-will-reduce-related-deaths/
